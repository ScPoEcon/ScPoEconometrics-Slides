# Welcome to ScPoEconometrics!

--

- In this course you will learn the core tools of ***econometrics***.
 
--

- You will also learn to use the `R` programming language!

--

## What is *econometrics*?

- A set of techniques and methods to answer questions with data.

- Econometrics shares many things with *applied statistics* and *machine learning*.

- Some examples!

---

# Answering Important Questions with Econometrics

[&lt;ru-blockquote&gt;
Does immigration *cause* lower wages and higher unemployment for locals?
&lt;/ru-blockquote&gt;](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf)

--

[&lt;ru-blockquote&gt;
Does increasing the minimum wage *cause* greater unemployment?
&lt;/ru-blockquote&gt;](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf)

--

[&lt;ru-blockquote&gt;
Does more education *cause* higher wages?
&lt;/ru-blockquote&gt;](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/causal_educ_earnings.pdf)

--

[&lt;ru-blockquote&gt;
Does higher public debt levels *cause* lower economic growth?
&lt;/ru-blockquote&gt;](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2014/wp1434.pdf)

--

[&lt;ru-blockquote&gt;
Does birth order *cause* differing education trajectories?
&lt;/ru-blockquote&gt;](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/120/2/669/1933962)

# Causality

.pull-left[

* Notice the keyword **cause** in all of the above.

* Notice also that *many other factors could have caused* each of those outcomes.

* Econometrics is often about spelling out conditions under which we can claim to measure causal relationships.

* We will encounter the most basic of those conditions, and talk about some potential pitfalls.
]

.pull-right[
As in the acclaimed [Book of Why](https://www.amazon.fr/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X) we often ask *why* did something happen?
]

---



# This Course

- Teach you the basics of ***linear regression***, ***statistical inference*** and ***impact evaluation***.

--

- Equip you with a framework to think more deeply about causality.

--

- Introduce you to the `R` software environment.

--

- ⚠️ This is *not* a course about `R`.

## What is `R`?

`R` is a __programming language__ with powerful statistical and graphic capabilities.

--

## Why are we using `R`?&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

--

1. `R` is __free__ and __open source__—saving both you and the university 💰💵💰.

--

1. `R` is very __flexible and powerful__—adaptable to nearly any task, _e.g._, data cleaning, data visualization, econometrics, spatial data analysis, machine learning, web scraping, ...

--

1. `R` has a vibrant, thriving online community that will (almost) always have a solution to your problem. ([stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r))

--

1. If you put in the work&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, you will come away with a __very valuable and marketable__ tool.

.footnote[
[1]: This list has been inspired by [Ed Rubin's](https://github.com/edrubin/EC421S19).  
[2]: Learning `R` definitely requires time and effort but it's worth it, trust me! 💪.

# Why can't we just use Excel?

Many reasons but here are just a few:

--

- Not reproducible.

--

- Not straightforward to merge datasets together.

--

- Very fastidious to clean data.

--

- Limited to small datasets

--

- Not designed for proper econometric analyses, maps, complex visualisations, etc.

# Showcase #1: Spatial Data

.pull-left[

* `R` is very strong with spatial data. In particular via the [`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) package.

* We can represent _any_ shape or geometry.

* Maps are the most obvious example:

```r
library(sf)
library(tmap)
iris_shfl &lt;- read_sf("chapter1_files/figure-html/contours_iris_2015/CONTOURS-IRIS.shp") %&gt;%
  mutate(dep = substr(INSEE_COM,1,2)) %&gt;%
  select(CODE_IRIS, dep, geometry) %&gt;%
  filter(dep == "75")
iris_income &lt;- readRDS("../rds/iris_inc.rds") %&gt;%
  mutate(CODE_IRIS = IRIS) %&gt;%
  select(CODE_IRIS, DISP_MED15)
iris_map &lt;- left_join(iris_shfl, iris_income, by = "CODE_IRIS")
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(iris_map) +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_fill(col = "DISP_MED15", title = "Median household income (euros)")
```
]

.pull-right[

* Can be improved but you get this with only __13 lines of code!__

# Showcase #2: Interactive web applications

--

- Santé publique France has created a [simple web application](https://cpelat.shinyapps.io/mass/) to track the epidemiological situation in French regions per week

# In Practice: Data Wrangling

--

* You will spend a lot of time preparing data for further analysis.

--

* The `gapminder` dataset contains data on life expectancy, GDP per capita and population by country between 1952 and 2007.

* Suppose we want to know the average life expectancy and average GDP per capita for each continent in each year. 

* We need to group the data by continent *and* year, then compute the average life expectancy and average GDP per capita

.left-column[

```r
  # load gapminder package
library(gapminder)
  # load the dataset in object gapminder
gapminder = gapminder::gapminder
  # display variables in the dataset
names(gapminder)
  # show first 4 lines of this dataframe
head(gapminder,n = 4)
```
]

.right-column[

```
## [1] "country"   "continent" "year"      "lifeExp"   "pop"       "gdpPercap"
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 6
##   country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
##   &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.
## 2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.
## 3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.
## 4 Afghanistan Asia       1967    34.0 11537966      836.
```
]

# In Practice: Data Wrangling

* There are always several ways to achieve a goal. (As in life 😄)

* Here we will only focus on the `dplyr` way:


```r
  # compute the required statistics
gapminder_dplyr &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% 
  group_by(continent, year) %&gt;% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    mean_lifeexp = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_gdppercap = mean(gdpPercap, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```


```r
  # show first 5 lines of this dataframe
head(gapminder_dplyr, n = 5)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 5
## # Groups:   continent [1]
##   continent  year count mean_lifeexp mean_gdppercap
##   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Africa     1952    52         39.1          1253.
## 2 Africa     1957    52         41.3          1385.
## 3 Africa     1962    52         43.3          1598.
## 4 Africa     1967    52         45.3          2050.
## 5 Africa     1972    52         47.5          2340.

# Visualisation

.pull-left[
* Now we could *look* at the result in `gapminder_dplyr`, or compute some statistics from it. 

* Nothing beats a picture, though:


```r
ggplot(data = gapminder_dplyr, 
       mapping = aes(x = mean_lifeexp,
                     y = mean_gdppercap,
                     color = continent,
                     size = count)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/3) +
  labs(x = "Average life expectancy",
       y = "Average GDP per capita",
       color = "Continent",
       size = "Nb of countries")
```

# Tool Time!

.pull-left[
## Getting R and Rstudio

* Download `R` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) for your OS.

* Download `RStudio` from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) for your OS.
]

---

# Start your `RStudio`!

## First Glossary of Terms

* `R`: a programming language.

* `RStudio`: an integrated development environment (IDE) to work with `R`.

--

* *command*: user input (text or numbers) that `R` *understands*.

* *script*: a list of commands collected in a text file, each separated by a new line, to be run one after the other.

--

* To run a script, you need to highlight the relevant code lines and hit `Ctrl`+`Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd`+`Enter` (Mac).

# R as a Calculator

.pull-left[

* You can use the `R` console like a calculator

* Just type an arithmetic operation after `&gt;` and hit `Enter`!

]

--

.pull-right[
* Some basic arithmetic first:
    
    ```r
    4 + 1
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] 5
    ```
    
    ```r
    8 / 2
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] 4
    ```


* Great! What about this?
    
    ```r
    log(exp(1))
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] 1
    ```
    
    ```r
    # by the way: this is a comment! (R disregards it)
    ```
]
---

class: inverse

# Task 1 (5 minutes)

* Create a new R script (File `\(\rightarrow\)` New File `\(\rightarrow\)` R Script). Save it somewhere as `lecture_intro.R`.

* Write in your script and run the following code: (`Ctrl` or `Cmd` + `Enter`)
    
    ```r
    4 * 8
    ```

* Write in your script and run the following code. What happens if you only run the first line of the code?
    
    ```r
    x = 5 # equivalently x &lt;- 5
    x
    ```

* Congratulations, you have created your first `R` "object"! Everything is an object in R! Objects are assigned using `=` or `&lt;-`.

* Lastly, find the cube of `x` and assign that value to `x_3`.

---

# Where to get Help?

* `R` built-in `help`:
    
    ```r
    ?log
    ?sin
    ?paste
    ?lm
    help(lm)   # help() is equivalent
    ??plot  # get all help on keyword "plot"
    help(ggplot,package="ggplot2")  # show help from a certain package
    ```

* Help from Humans!
  * Google is your best friend!
  * [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com) [SO]
  * Your classroom channel on Slack
  * [rstudio forum](https://community.rstudio.com)
  
---

# HOW to get Help? Follow this for Slack questions!

1. Describe what you want to do.

1. Describe what you *expect* your code to do.

1. Describe what your code *does instead*.
  * Provide the entire error message.
  
1. Provide enough code to *reproduce* your error.
  * You can post post code snippets on Slack and Stack Overflow

---

# R Packages

* `R` users contribute add-on data and functions as *packages*

* Installing packages is easy!
    
    ```r
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    ```

* To *use* the contents of a packge, we must load it from our library:
    
    ```r
    library(ggplot2)
    ```

---

# `ScPoApps` package

* We wrote an `R` package for you.

* It's hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ScPoEcon/ScPoApps)

* You can install (and frequently update!) from here:
    
    ```r
    if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    install_github(repo = "ScPoEcon/ScPoApps")
    ```

--

* Did it work?
    
    ```r
    library(ScPoApps)
    packageVersion("ScPoApps")
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] '0.1'
    ```

---

# Vectors

* What *is* a **vector**?

* The `c` function creates vectors.
    
    ```r
    c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9
    ```

* Coercion to unique types:
    
    ```r
    c(42, "Statistics", TRUE)
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] "42"         "Statistics" "TRUE"
    ```

* Creating a *range*
    
    ```r
    c(y = 1:6)
    ```
    
    ```
    ## y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 y6 
    ##  1  2  3  4  5  6
    ```

---

# `data.frame`'s

`data.frame`s are like spreadsheets.


```r
example_data = data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 5, 7),
                          y = c(rep("Hello", 3), "Goodbye"),
                          z = sample(c(TRUE,FALSE),size=4,replace=TRUE))
example_data
```

```
##   x       y     z
## 1 1   Hello FALSE
## 2 3   Hello  TRUE
## 3 5   Hello FALSE
## 4 7 Goodbye FALSE
```

In practice, you will be importing files that contain the data into `R` rather than creating `data.frame`s by hand.

---

class: inverse

# Task 2 (10 minutes)

* Find out (using `help()` or google) how to import a .csv file.

* Import [gun_murders.csv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zuk0qcfm3kyzs4e/gun_murders.csv?dl=1)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in a new object `murders`. This file contains data on gun murders by US state in 2010. (Hint: objects are created using `=`)



* Ensure that `murders` is a data.frame by running:
    
    ```r
    # Check class
    class(murder)
    ```

* Find out what variables are contained in `murders` by running:
    
    ```r
    # Obain variable names
    names(murders)
    ```

* View the contents of `murders` by clicking on `murders` in your workspace
  - What does the `total` variable correspond to?

.footnote[
[1]: This dataset is taken from the `dslabs` package.
]

---

# `data.frame`s

* Useful methods for a dataframe:

```r
str(murders) # describes the data.frame
```

```
## 'data.frame':	51 obs. of  5 variables:
##  $ state     : chr  "Alabama" "Alaska" "Arizona" "Arkansas" ...
##  $ abb       : chr  "AL" "AK" "AZ" "AR" ...
##  $ region    : Factor w/ 4 levels "Northeast","South",..: 2 4 4 2 4 4 1 2 2 2 ...
##  $ population: num  4779736 710231 6392017 2915918 37253956 ...
##  $ total     : num  135 19 232 93 1257 ...
```

```r
names(murders) # column names
```

```
## [1] "state"      "abb"        "region"     "population" "total"
```

```r
nrow(murders) # number of rows
```

```
## [1] 51
```

```r
ncol(murders) # number of columns
```

```
## [1] 5
```

---

# Data on Gun Murders in the US

* Let's look at the first rows of `murders`.
    
    ```r
    head(murders, n = 3)  # show first 3 rows
    ```
    
    ```
    ##     state abb region population total
    ## 1 Alabama  AL  South    4779736   135
    ## 2  Alaska  AK   West     710231    19
    ## 3 Arizona  AZ   West    6392017   232
    ```
    
* To access one of the variables **as a vector**, we use the `$` operator as in `murders$state`. We can check the type of `murders$state` with
    
    ```r
    class(murders$state)  # type of the state variable in the murders data.frame
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] "character"
    ```

* Or we use the column name or index: `murders[,"state"]` or `murders[,1]`

---

# Subsetting `data.frames`

* Subsetting a data.frame: `murders[row condition, column number]` or `murders[row condition, "column name"]`
    
    ```r
    # Only keep states with over 500 gun murders and keep only the "state" and "total" variables
    murders[murders$total &gt; 500, c("state", "total")]
    ```
    
    ```
    ##         state total
    ## 5  California  1257
    ## 10    Florida   669
    ## 33   New York   517
    ## 44      Texas   805
    ```
    
* But there is a special function which looks nicer.
    
    ```r
    subset(murders, subset = total &gt; 500, select = c("state", "total"))
    ```
    
    ```
    ##         state total
    ## 5  California  1257
    ## 10    Florida   669
    ## 33   New York   517
    ## 44      Texas   805
    ```

---

class: inverse

# Task 3 (10 minutes)

1. How many observations are there in `murders`?

1. How many variables? What are the data types of each variable?

1. Notice that the colon operator `a:b` is just short for *construct a sequence from `a` to `b`*. Create a new object `murders_2` containing the rows 10 to 25 of `murders`.

1. Create a new object `murders_3` which only contains the columns `state` and `total`. (Recall that `c` creates vectors.)

1. What is the average value of `total`?

1. What is the average value of `total` for state's in the "South", i.e. with `region == "South"`?

1. Create a total_percap variable:
    
    ```r
    murders$total_percap = (murders$total / murders$population) * 10000
    ```

Congratulations, you've created your first variable!
