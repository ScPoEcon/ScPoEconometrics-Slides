# Recap from last week

* ***Causality*** plays a central role in modern econometrics!

--

* Using R is ***very*** valuable

--

* Basic data wrangling:
  - `str`, `names`, `nrow`, `ncol`
  - *subsetting:* `murders[row condition, "column name"]`
  - *variable creation:* `murders$total_percap = (murders$total / murders$population) * 10000`

--

## Today

* Deeper dive into data wrangling with `R`:
  - __summarizing__ data,
  - __visualisation__ data,
  - __tidying__ data

---
  
# Working With Data

* Econometrics is about `data`.

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("chapter2_files/figure-html/data_science_pipeline.png")
```

--

* According a to [2014 NYTimes article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html), "data scientists [...] spend from ***50 percent to 80 percent of their time*** mired in this more mundane labor of collecting and preparing unruly digital data, before it can be explored for useful nuggets."

* In the next two lectures you will learn to the basics of summarizing, visualising and tidying data

---

# The `gapminder` dataset: Overview

* Let's first load a dataset with these commands:
    ```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    library(dslabs)
    gapminder <- gapminder
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
    gapminder <- dslabs::gapminder
    ```

* Here are the first 3 rows
    ```{r}
    head(gapminder, n = 3)
    ```

---
# The `gapminder` dataset: Overview

* What variables does this dataset contain?
    ```{r}
    names(gapminder)
    ```

* `tail` gives you the last (6) rows.
    ```{r,eval = FALSE}
    tail(gapminder)
    ```

---

# The `gapminder` dataset: Datatypes

* It's important to know how the data is stored.

* We can use `str` for that:

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

---

class: inverse

# Task 1 (7 minutes)

* Create a new variable called `gdppercap` corresponding to `gdp` divided by `population`

* Which countries had a 2011 GDP per capita greater than 30.000? 

* Filter the dataset to only keep the year 2015: `gapminder_2015`

* How many countries have an infant mortality in 2015 greater than 90 (per 1000)?

* What is the average life expectancy in Africa in 2015?

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# ANSWERS

* gapminder$gdppercap <- gapminder$gdp / gapminder$population

* subset(gapminder, year == 2011 & gdppercap > 30000)

* gapminder_2015 <- subset(gapminder, year == 2015)

* nrow(subset(gapminder_2011, infant_mortality > 90))

* mean(gapminder_2015[gapminder_2015$continent == "Africa", "life_expectancy"])
  # also possible to use subset() but need to create new object

# Summarizing Data


* One can learn only a limited amount from **looking** at a `data.frame`. `r emo::ji("mag")`

--

* Even if you *could* see all rows of the dataset, you would not know very much **about it**.

--

* We need to **summarize** the data for us to learn from it.

--

* In general, we can compute summary statistics, or visualize the data with plots.

--

* Let's start with some statistics first!

--

* Let's look at two features: *central tendency* and *spread*.

---

# Central Tendency


.pull-left[
1. `mean(x)`: the average of all values in `x`.
$$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i$$

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,2,2,2,100)
mean(x)
mean(x) == sum(x) / length(x)
```

***Your turn:*** What's the mean of `infant_mortality` in 1960? Read the help for `mean` to remove `NA`s.
]

--

.pull-right[
1. `median`: the value $x_j$ below and above which 50% of the values in `x` lie. $m$ is the median if
    $$\Pr(X \leq m) \geq 0.5 \text{ and } \Pr(X \geq m) \geq 0.5$$
    
1. The median is robust against *outliers*. `r emo::ji("thinking")`? (later).

```{r}
median(x)
```

***Your turn:*** What's the median of `infant_mortality` in 1960?
]

---

# Missing Values: `NA`

.pull-left[
* Whenever a value is *missing*, we code it as `NA`.
    ```{r, echo = TRUE}
    x <- NA
    ```
* `R` propagates `NA` through operations:
    ```{r, echo = TRUE}
    NA > 5
    NA + 10
    ```
* the function `is.na(x)` returns `TRUE` if `x` is an `NA`.
    ```{r, echo = TRUE}
    is.na(x)
    ```
]

--

.pull-right[
* What is confusing is that 
    ```{r, echo = TRUE}
    NA == NA
    ```

* It's easy to illustrate like that:
    ```{r, echo = TRUE}
    # Let x be Mary's age. We don't know how old she is.
    x <- NA
    
    # Let y be John's age. We don't know how old he is.
    y <- NA
    
    # Are John and Mary the same age?
    x == y
    #> [1] NA
    # We don't know!
    ```
]

---

# Spread

.pull-left[
* Another interesting feature is how much a variable is *spread out* about it's center (the mean in this case).

* The *variance* is such a measure.
    $$Var(X) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N(x_i-\bar{x})^2$$
    
* Consider two `normal distributions` with equal mean at `0`:

```

* Compute with:

```{r,eval = FALSE}
    var(x)
    range(x)   # range
    ```
]
---

# The `table` function

* `table(x)` is a useful function that counts the occurence of each unique value in `x`:
    ```{r}
    table(gapminder$continent)
    table(gapminder$region)
    ```

---

# Crosstables


* Given two vectors, `table` produces a contingency table:
    ```{r}
    gapminder_2015 <- subset(gapminder, year == 2015)
    gapminder_2015$fertility_above_2 = (gapminder_2015$fertility > 2.1) # dummy variable for fertility rate above replacement level fertility
    table(gapminder_2015$fertility_above_2,gapminder_2015$continent)
    ```

--

* With `prop.table`, we can get proportions:
    ```{r,eval=FALSE}
    # proportions by row
    prop.table(table(gapminder_2015$fertility_above_2,gapminder_2015$continent), margin = 1)
    # proportions by column
    prop.table(table(gapminder_2015$fertility_above_2,gapminder_2015$continent), margin = 2) 
    ```

* `r emo::ji("warning")` To obtain `table`s or `crosstable`s with `NA`s, use the `useNA = "always"` or `useNA = "ifany"`

# Plotting

.pull-left[

* There is an extremely powerful alternative in package `ggplot2`. We'll see both.

* First example: *histograms*. A histogram counts how many obserations fall within a certain bin.

# Looking for Outliers: Boxplots

* An *outlier* is a datapoint far removed from the center of a distribution.

* Boxplots are an effective way to visualise the distribution of a variable.

* The *box* typically denotes the __interquartile range__ (observations between 25th pctile and 75th pctile).

* The *thick line* corresponds to the __median__.

* The *dots* are __outliers__ (`r emo::ji("warning")` no universally accepted definition).

# `dplyr` Overview

.pull-left[
<br>
<br>
* You *must* read through [Hadley Wickham's chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html). It's concise.

* The package is organized around a set of **verbs**, i.e. *actions* to be taken.

* We operate on `data.frames` or `tibbles` (*nicer looking* data.frames.)

* All *verbs*: First argument is a data.frame, subsequent arguments describe what to do, returns another data.frame.

]

.pull-right[

## Verbs

1. `filter()`: Choose observations based on a certain value (i.e. subset)

1. `arrange()`: Reorder rows 

1. `select()`: Select variables by name

1. `mutate()`: Create new variables out of existing ones

1. `summarise()`: Summarise variables

    ```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    filter(polls_us_election_2016,
           grade == "A" & samplesize > 2000 & rawpoll_trump > 45)
    ```

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    filter(polls_us_election_2016,
           grade == "A" & samplesize > 2000 & rawpoll_trump > 45)
    ```

# Create a Filter: Comparisons and Logical Operators

.pull-left[
* We have a standard suite of comparison operators:
  - `>`: greater than,
  - `<`: smaller than,
  - `>=`: greater than or equal to,
  - `<=`: smaller than or equal to,
  - `!=`: not equal to,
  - `==`: equal to.

* Construct more complex filters with logical operators
    1. `x & y`: `x` **and** `y`
    1. `x | y`: `x` **or** `y`
    1. `!y`: **not** `y`
]

.pull-right[
* `R` has the convenient `x %in% y` operator (conversely `!(x %in% y)`), `TRUE` if `x` is *a member of* `y`.
    ```{r, echo = TRUE}
    3 %in% 1:3
    c(2,5) %in% 2:10  # also vectorized
    c("S","Po") %in% c("Sciences","Po")  # also strings
    ```
]

---

# `mutate()`: create new variables

* *Example*: What was
    1. the combined vote share of Trump and Clinton for each poll?
    2. the difference between Trump's raw poll vote share and 538's adjusted vote share?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mutate(polls_us_election_2016,
       trump_clinton_tot = rawpoll_trump + rawpoll_clinton,
       trump_raw_adj_diff = rawpoll_trump - adjpoll_trump)
```

# `select()`: only keep some variables

* *Example*: Only keep the variables `state,startdate,enddate,pollster,rawpoll_clinton,rawpoll_trump`
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
select(polls_us_election_2016,
       state,startdate,enddate,pollster,rawpoll_clinton,rawpoll_trump)
```

# Task 2 (10 minutes)

1. Which polls had more vote intentions for Trump than for Clinton.

1. How many polls have a missing `grade`?

1. Which polls were (i) polled by American Strategies, GfK Group or Merrill Poll, _and_ (ii) had a sample size greater than 1,000, _and_ (iii) started on October 20th, 2016?

*For the following questions you should use `filter` and `mutate`.*

1. Which polls (i) did not have missing poll data for Johnson, (ii) had a combined raw poll vote share for Trump and Clinton greater than 95% _and_ (iii) had a sample size greater than 1,000.?

1. Which polls (i) did not poll for vote intentions for Johnson, (ii) had a difference in raw poll vote shares between Trump and Clinton greater than 5, and (iii) were done in the state of Iowa?

# Split-Apply-Combine

.pull-left[
* Often we do *some* operation **by** some group in our dataset:
    * Mean vote share for Clinton by pollster grade.
    * Maximum vote share for Trump by poll month, etc

* For this, we need to 
    1. Split the data **by** group
    2. Apply to each group the operation
    3. Recombine all groups into one table
    
* In `dplyr`, this is achieved with `group_by()` and `summarise`.

.pull-right[
1. `group_by(polls_us_election_2016, grade)` groups/splits `polls_us_election_2016` by pollster `grade`:
    ```{r dplyr1}
    polls_grade = group_by(polls_us_election_2016, grade)
    ```

1. `summarise` each chunk and re-combine
    ```{r}
    summarise(polls_grade, mean_vote_clinton = mean(rawpoll_clinton))
    ```

# Chaining `r emo::ji("link")` Commands Together: The Pipe

* The `magrittr` package gives us the *pipe* `%>%`.

* `x %>% f(y)` becomes `f(x,y)`.

* With the *pipe* you construct data *pipelines*.

--

.pull-left[
Our above example would become:
```{r pipe, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
polls_us_election_2016 %>%
  group_by(grade) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_vote_clinton = mean(rawpoll_clinton)
    )
```
which is equivalent to, but nicer than:
```{r,eval = FALSE}
summarise(
  group_by(polls_us_election_2016, grade),
  mean_vote_clinton = mean(rawpoll_clinton))
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Works for all `dplyr` verbs:
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
polls_us_election_2016 %>%
  mutate(trump_clinton_diff = rawpoll_trump-rawpoll_clinton) %>%
  filter(trump_clinton_diff>5 &
        state == "Iowa" &
        is.na(rawpoll_johnson)) %>%
  select(pollster)
```
