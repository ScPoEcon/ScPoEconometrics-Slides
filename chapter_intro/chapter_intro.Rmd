# Welcome to ScPoEconometrics!

--

- In this course you will learn the core tools of ***econometrics***.
 
--

- You will also learn to use the `R` programming language!

--

## What is *econometrics*?

- A set of ***techniques and methods*** to answer (economic) questions with ***data***.

- Some examples!

---

# Causality

* Notice that ***many other factors could have caused*** each of the outcomes mentioned.

--

* Often, we'll want to focus on the ***causal impact*** of just one of these factors (immigration, minimum wage, education ,etc.)

--

* Econometrics is about spelling out ***conditions*** under which we can ***claim to measure causal relationships***.

* We will encounter the most basic of those conditions, and talk about some potential pitfalls.

## What is `R`?

`R` is a __programming language__ with powerful statistical and graphic capabilities.

--

## Why are we using `R`?<sup>1</sup>

<span style="visibility:hidden">[2]: Learning `R` definitely requires time and effort but it's worth it, trust me! `r emo::ji("muscle")`.</span>
]

--

1. `R` is __free__ and __open source__â€”saving both you and the university ðŸ’°ðŸ’µðŸ’°.

--

1. `R` is very __flexible and powerful__â€”adaptable to nearly any task, (data cleaning, data visualization, econometrics, spatial data analysis, machine learning, web scraping, etc.)

--

1. `R` has a vibrant, [thriving online community](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) that will (almost) always have a solution to your problem.

--

1. If you put in the work<sup>2</sup>, you will come away with a __very valuable and useful__ tool.

<!-- # Why can't we just use Excel? -->

<!-- Many reasons but here are just a few: -->

<!-- - Not ***reproducible***. -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Not straightforward to ***merge*** datasets together. -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Very fastidious to ***clean*** data. -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Limited to ***small datasets***. -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Not designed for proper ***econometric analyses***, maps, complex visualisations, etc. -->

# In Practice: Data Wrangling

--

* You will spend a lot of time preparing data for further analysis.

--

* The `gapminder` dataset contains data on life expectancy, GDP per capita and population by country between 1952 and 2007.

* Suppose we want to know the average life expectancy and average GDP per capita for each continent in each year.

--

* We need to group the data by continent *and* year, then compute the average life expectancy and average GDP per capita

--

.pull-left[
```{r, gapminder, echo = T, eval = F}
# load gapminder package
library(gapminder)
# load the dataset from the gapminder package
data(gapminder, package = "gapminder") 
# show first 4 lines of this dataframe
head(gapminder,n = 4)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, gapminder, echo = F, eval = T}
```
]

---

# In Practice: Data Wrangling

* There are always several ways to achieve a goal. (As in life `r emo::ji("smile")`)

* Here we will only focus on the `dplyr` way:

```{r}
# compute the required statistics
gapminder_dplyr <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent, year) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(),
            mean_lifeexp = mean(lifeExp),
            mean_gdppercap = mean(gdpPercap))
```

```{r}
# show first 5 lines of the new data
head(gapminder_dplyr, n = 5)
```

---

# Visualisation

.pull-left[
* Now we could *look* at the result in `gapminder_dplyr`, or compute some statistics from it. 

* Nothing beats a picture, though:

```{r gampminder_plot, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder_dplyr, 
       mapping = aes(x = mean_lifeexp,
                     y = mean_gdppercap,
                     color = continent,
                     size = count)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/2) +
  labs(x = "Average life expectancy",
       y = "Average GDP per capita",
       color = "Continent",
       size = "Nb of countries") +
  theme_bw()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r gampminder_plot, echo = FALSE}
```

# Start your `RStudio`!

## First Glossary of Terms

* `R`: a programming language.

* `RStudio`: an integrated development environment (IDE) to work with `R`.

--

* *command*: user input (text or numbers) that `R` *understands*.

* *script*: a list of commands collected in a text file, each separated by a new line, to be run one after the other.

--

* To run a script, you need to highlight the relevant code lines and hit `Ctrl`+`Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd`+`Enter` (Mac).

---

# `RStudio` Layout

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("chapter_intro_files/figure-html/rstudio.png")
```

---

# R as a Calculator

* You can use the `R` console like a calculator

* Just type an arithmetic operation after `>` and hit `Enter`!

--

* Some basic arithmetic first:
```{r}
4 + 1
8 / 2
```


* Great! What about this?
```{r}
2^3
# by the way: this is a comment! R therefore disregards it
```

---

# Task 1

`r countdown(minutes = 5, top = 0)`

1. Create a new R script (File $\rightarrow$ New File $\rightarrow$ R Script). Save it somewhere as `lecture_intro.R`.

1. Type the following code in your script and run it. To run the code press `Ctrl` or `Cmd` + `Enter` (you can either highlight the code or just put your cursor at the end of the line)
    ```{r, eval = F}
    4 * 8
    ```

1. Type the following code in your script and run it. What happens if you only run the first line of the code?
    ```{r, eval = F}
    x = 5 # equivalently x <- 5
    x
    ```
Congratulations, you have created your first `R` "object"! Everything is an object in R! Objects are assigned using `=` or `<-`.

1. Create a new object named `x_3` to which you assign the cube of `x`. Note that to assign you need to use `=` or `<-`. Use code to compute the cube, not a calculator.

# Where to get Help?

.pull-left[
`R` built-in `help`:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?log #? in front of function
help(lm)   # help() is equivalent
??plot  # get all help on keyword "plot"
```
]

---

# R Packages

* `R` users contribute add-on data and functions as *packages*

* Installing packages is easy! Just use the `install.packages` function:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    ```

* To *use* the contents of a packge, we must load it from our library using `library`:
    ```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE,eval=FALSE}
    library(ggplot2)
    ```

---

# Vectors



.pull-left[
* The `c` function creates vectors, i.e. *one-dimensional arrays*.
    ```{r}
    c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
    ```
    
* Coercion to unique types:
    ```{r}
    (v <- c(42, "Statistics", TRUE))
    ```
]

--

.pull-right[

* Creating a *range*
    ```{r}
    1:10
    ```

* get vector elements with square bracket operator `[index]`:
    ```{r}
    v[c(1,3)]
    ```
]

---

# `data.frame`'s

`data.frame`s represent **tabular data**. Like spreadsheets.

```{r}
example_data = data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 5, 7),
                          y = c(rep("Hello", 3), "Goodbye"),
                          z = c("one", 2, "three", 4))
example_data
```

* A `data.frame` has 2 dimensions: *rows* and *columns*. Like a *matrix*. Can get elements with `[row_index,col_index]`.

* In practice, you will be importing files that contain the data into `R` rather than creating `data.frame`s by hand.

# Task 2

`r countdown(minutes = 7, top = 0)`

```{r, echo=F}
murders <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/zuk0qcfm3kyzs4e/gun_murders.csv?dl=1")
```

1. Find out (using `help()` or google) how to import a .csv file. Do NOT use the "Import Dataset" button, nor install a package.

1. Import [gun_murders.csv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zuk0qcfm3kyzs4e/gun_murders.csv?dl=1)<sup>1</sup> in a new object `murders`. This file contains data on gun murders by US state in 2010. (Hint: objects are created using `=` or `<-`).

1. Ensure that `murders` is a data.frame by running:
    ```{r,eval=F}
    class(murder) # check class
    ```

1. Find out what variables are contained in `murders` by running:
    ```{r, eval = F}
    names(murders) # obtain variable names
    ```

1. View the contents of `murders` by clicking on `murders` in your workspace. What does the `total` variable correspond to?

# `data.frame`s

Useful functions to describe a dataframe:
```{r}
str(murders) # `str` describes structure of any R object
```

--

```{r}
names(murders) # column names
```

--

```{r}
nrow(murders) # number of rows
```

--

```{r}
ncol(murders) # number of columns
```

---

# Subsetting `data.frames`

* Subsetting a data.frame: `murders[row condition, column number]` or `murders[row condition, "column name"]`
    ```{r}
    # Only keep states with over 500 gun murders and keep only the "state" and "total" variables
    murders[murders$total > 500, c("state", "total")]
    
    # Only keep California and Texas and keep only the "state" and "total" variables
    murders[murders$state %in% c("California", "Texas"), c("state", "total")]
    ```

---

# Accessing `data.frame` Columns
    
* To extract one column **as a vector** we can use the `$` operator (as in `murders$state`), or the square bracket operator `[which_index]` with name or position index:
    ```{r}
    first5 <- murders[1:5, ]  # take first 5 states only
    first5$state  # extract with $ operator
    first5[ ,"state"]  # extract with column name
    first5[ ,1] # get first column
    ```

--

.pull-left[
* Check `class` of an object:
    ```{r}
    class(murders)
    ```
]

--

.pull-right[
* `typeof` gives the R-internal data type:
    ```{r}
    typeof(murders)
    ```
]


---

class: inverse

# Task 3

`r countdown(minutes = 10, top = 0)`

1. How many observations are there in `murders`?

1. How many variables? What are the data types of each variable?

1. Remember that the colon operator `1:10` is just short for *construct a sequence from `1` to `10`* (i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc). Create a new object `murders_2` containing the rows 10 to 25 of `murders`.

1. Create a new object `murders_3` which only contains the columns `state` and `total`. (Recall that `c` creates vectors.)

1. Create a `total_percap` variable equal to the number of murders per 10,000 inhabitants by running the following code.
    ```{r}
    murders$total_percap = (murders$total / murders$population) * 10000
    ```

Congratulations, you've created your first variable! Click on the `murders` object to see the new variable.
