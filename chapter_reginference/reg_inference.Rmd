---

# Understanding Regression Tables

Here is our `tidy` regression:
```{r}
library(broom)
tidy(lm(math ~ small, star_df))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
reg_summary_star_df = round(summary(reg_star)$coefficients,2)
```


* There are 3 new columns here: `std.error`, `statistic`, `p.value`.

--

Entry | Meaning
----- | ----
`std. error` |  Standard error of $b_k$
`statistic` |  Observed test statistic associated to $H_0:\beta_k = 0,H_A:\beta_k \neq 0$
`p.value` |  p-value associated to $H_0:\beta_k = 0,H_A:\beta_k \neq 0$

--

* Let's focus on the `small` coefficient and make sense of each entry.

---

# Standard Error of $b_k$

> ***Standard Error of $b_k$:*** Standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $b_k$.

--

Let's imagine we could redo the experiment 1000 times on 1000 different samples:

* We'd run 1000 regression and would get 1000 estimates of $\beta_k$, $b_k$.

--

* The standard error of $b_k$ quantifies how much variation in $b_k$ one would expect across (*an infinity of*) samples.

---

# Standard Error of $b_\textrm{small}$

* From the table, we get $\hat{\textrm{SE}}(b_\textrm{small}) = `r reg_summary_star_df[2,2]`$
  
  * Notice that we write $\hat{\textrm{SE}}$ and not ${\textrm{SE}}$ because `r reg_summary_star_df[2,2]` is an estimate of the real standard error of $b_\textrm{small}$ we get from our sample.

--

* Let's simulate the sampling distribution of $b_\textrm{small}$ to see where it comes from.
    
---

class:inverse

# Task 1 (10 min)

As we did for the sampling distribution of the proportion of *green pasta*, we want to generate the bootstrap distribution of $b_\textrm{small}$. 

1. Copy the loading and cleaning code from slide 3 and run it.

1. Generate the bootstrap distribution of $b_\textrm{small}$ based on 1000 samples drawn from `star_df`. *Hint*: use the appropriate functions and arguments from the `infer` package so use the help pages.

1. Plot this simulated sampling distribution and compute mean and the standard error of $b_\textrm{small}$.

---

# Bootstrap Distribution

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 4.75, fig.width = 8}
library(infer)
bootstrap_distrib = star_df %>% 
    specify(formula = math ~ small) %>%
    generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
    calculate(stat = "slope", order = c("TRUE","FALSE"))
se_simul = round(sd(bootstrap_distrib$stat),3)

bootstrap_distrib %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = stat)) +
    geom_histogram(boundary = 9, binwidth = 0.5, col = "white", fill = "#d90502") +
    labs(
        x = "Bootstrap sample slope estimate",
        y = "Frequency"
    ) +
    theme_bw(base_size = 14)
```

--

***standard error:*** `r round(se_simul,2)` $\rightarrow$ very close to the one in the table (`r reg_summary_star_df[2,2]`)!

---

# Testing $\beta_k = 0$ vs $\beta_k \neq 0$

By default, the regression output provides the results associated with the following hypothesis test: 

$$\begin{align}H_0:& \beta_k = 0\\H_A:& \beta_k \neq 0\end{align}$$

--

* It allows to statistically test if there is a true relationship between the outcome and our regressor. 

--

* If $H_0$ is true, there is **no** relationship between the outcome and our regressor. 

  * In that case observing $b_1 \neq 0$ was just chance.

--

* If $H_0$ is false, then there **is** a true relationship. 

--

* ***Important:*** This is a ***two-sided*** test!

---

# Test statistic and p-value

* As we saw in the previous lecture, to conduct such a test we need to:

--

  * Derive the sampling distribution of our **test statistic** (`statistic`) assuming $H_0$ is true, i.e. the *null distribution*.
  
--

  * Quantify how extreme the **observed test statistic** is in this hypothetic world.

--

* Our *observed test statistic* (`statistic`) equals $\frac{b}{\hat{SE}(b)}$.

  * Why not just $b$? We'll come back and explain this formula later.

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
observed_stat = reg_star$coefficients[2]/sd(bootstrap_distrib$stat)
round(observed_stat,2)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
* Quite close to the observed test statistic we got in the table: `statistic` = `r reg_summary_star_df[2,3]`.
]
--

* The **p-value** measures the area outside of $\pm$ *observed test statistic* under the *null distribution*.

--

* Finally, we check if we can reject $H_0$ at the usual **significance levels**: $\alpha$ = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01.

---

# Testing $\beta_\textrm{small} = 0$ vs $\beta_\textrm{small} \neq 0$

* We will approximate the null distribution of $\frac{b_\textrm{small}}{\hat{SE}(b_\textrm{small})}$ through a simulation exercise. 

--

* If there is no relationship between math score and class size, i.e. $H_0$ is true, then *reshuffling* / *permuting* the values of `small` across students should play no role.

--

.pull-left[
* Let's generate 1000 permuted samples and compute $b_\textrm{small}$ for each.

```{r}
null_distribution <- star_df %>% 
  specify(formula = math ~ small) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "slope", order = c("TRUE","FALSE"))
```
]

--

.pull-right[

* We can compute the distribution of our test statistic $\frac{b_\textrm{small}}{\hat{SE}(b_\textrm{small})}$ under the null:

```{r}
null_distribution <- null_distribution %>%
  mutate(test_stat = stat/sd(bootstrap_distrib$stat))
```

* Remember we got $\hat{SE}(b_\textrm{small})$ = `r round(sd(bootstrap_distrib$stat),2)` from our bootstrap distribution.

Very unlikely to obtain $b_\textrm{small}$ = `r coeff_star[2]` when $H_0$ is true.

---

# Testing $\beta_\textrm{small} = 0$ vs $\beta_\textrm{small} \neq 0$

* To decide if we reject $H_0$, recall we are considering a **two-sided test** here: *more extreme* means inferior to `r round(-observed_stat,3)` **or** superior to `r round(observed_stat,3)`. 

---

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height = 4.75, fig.width = 8}

  geom_vline(xintercept = -observed_stat, size = 1.25)

```

What does the p-value correspond to?

---

# Testing $\beta_\textrm{small} = 0$ vs $\beta_\textrm{small} \neq 0$

* To decide if we reject $H_0$, recall we are considering a **two-sided test** here: *more extreme* means inferior to `r round(-observed_stat,2)` **or** superior to `r round(observed_stat,2)`. 

* Computing the *p-value* we get:

```{r}
p_value = mean(abs(null_distribution$test_stat) >= observed_stat)
p_value
```

--

* This is the same value as in the regression table.

--

* ***Question:*** Can we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level?

---

# Testing $\beta_\textrm{small} = 0$ vs $\beta_\textrm{small} \neq 0$

* To decide if we reject $H_0$, recall we are considering a **two-sided test** here: *more extreme* means inferior to `r round(-observed_stat,2)` **or** superior to `r round(observed_stat,2)`. 

* Computing the *p-value* we get:

```{r}
p_value = mean(abs(null_distribution$test_stat) >= observed_stat)
p_value
```

* This is the same value as in the regression table.

* ***Answer:***

  * Since the *p-value* is equal to 0 it means that we would reject $H_0$ at any significance level: the p-value would always be inferior to $\alpha$.
  * In other words, we can say that $b_\textrm{small}$ is **statistically different from 0** at any significance level.
  * We also say that $b_\textrm{small}$ is *statistically significant* (at any significance level).

# Regression Inference: Theory

---

layout: true

<div class="my-footer"><img src="../img/logo/ScPo-shield.png" style="height: 60px;"/></div> 

---

# Regression Inference: Theory

* Up to now we presented simulation-based inference.

--

* The values reported by statistical packages in `R` are instead obtained from theory.

--

* Theoretical inference is based on **large sample approximations**.
  * One can show that sampling distributions *converge* to suitable distributions.
  
--
  
* Let's briefly look into the theory-based approach.

---

# Regression Inference: Theory

* Theory-based approach uses one fundamental result: the sampling distribution of the sample statistic $\frac{b - \beta}{\hat{\textrm{SE}(b)}}$ *converges* to a ***standard normal distribution*** as the sample size gets larger and larger.

  * $\hat{\textrm{SE}(b)}$ is the sample estimate of the standard deviation of $b$.
  * It is also obtained through a theoretical formula (which you can find in the [book](https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics/std-errors.html#se-theory)!) but we'll leave it aside.

--

* A ***standard normal distribution*** is a *normal distribution* with *mean* 0 and *standard deviation* 1.

--

* We don't need to simulate any sampling distribution here, we derive it from theory and use it to construct confidence intervals or to conduct hypothesis tests.

--

* Note that if $\frac{b - \beta}{\hat{\textrm{SE}(b)}}$ *converges* to a ***standard normal distribution***, then $b$ converges to a ***normal distribution*** with mean $\beta$ and standard deviation $\hat{\textrm{SE}(b)}$.

---

# Standard Normal Distribution: A Refresher

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "850px"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/photos/standard_normal_distrib.png")
```
]

---

# Theory-Based Inference: Confidence Interval

* Let's take the example of a 95% confidence interval.

--

* Since the sampling distribution of $b$ is assumed to be normally shaped, we can use the ***95% rule of thumb*** about normal distributions.

--

* We know indeed that 95% of the values of a normal distribution lie within approximately 2 standard deviations of the mean (exactly 1.96).

--

* So, we can compute a 95% CI for $\beta$ as: $\textrm{CI}_{95\%} = [ b \pm 1.96*\hat{\textrm{SE}}(b)]$

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
tidy(lm(math ~ small, star_df),
     conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95) %>%
  filter(term == "smallTRUE") %>%
  select(term, conf.low, conf.high)
```
]

--
.pull-right[
```{r}
bootstrap_distrib %>%
  summarise(
    lower_bound = 8.895 - 1.96*sd(stat),
    upper_bound = 8.895 + 1.96*sd(stat))
```
]

--

* This can easily be generalized to any confidence level by taking the appropriate quantile of the normal distribution.

---

class:inverse

# Task 2 (5 min)

1. Using the bootstrap distributed you generated in Task 1, compute the 95% confidence interval using the *percentile method*.

1. How similar is it to the confidence intervals obtained in the previous slide?

---

# Theory-Based Inference: Hypothesis Testing

* As we already mentioned, the default test that is conducted by any statistical software is:

$$\begin{align}H_0:& \beta_k = 0\\H_A:& \beta_k \neq 0\end{align}$$
--

* So, **under the null hypothesis** we get from theory that the sampling distribution of $\frac{b}{\hat{\textrm{SE}(b)}}$ will be a standard normal distribution.

--

* As such we can directly compare the observed test statistic $\frac{b}{\hat{\textrm{SE}(b)}}$ to the *standard normal distribution* which is the **null distribution** of our test statistic. 

--

* The ***p-value*** associated to our test is then equal to the area of the *standard normal distribution* outside $\pm$ the observed value of $\frac{b}{\hat{\textrm{SE}(b)}}$.

--

* Common rule of thumb: if the *estimate* is ***twice the size of the standard error***, then it is significant at the 5% level. Why?

---

# Classical Regression Model

---

# Classical Regression Model

* Whether the inference is made from theory or simulations, some assumptions have to be met for this inference to be valid.

* The set of assumptions needed defines the *Classical Regression Model* (CRM).

--

* Before delving into these assumptions, let's see the small but important modifications we apply to our model (back to [*lecture 4*](https://raw.githack.com/ScPoEcon/ScPoEconometrics-Slides/master/chapter3/chapter3.html#1)):

--

  * We already mentioned the distinction between the sample estimate $b_k$ (or $\hat{\beta_k}$) and the population parameter $\beta_k$.

--

  * In the same way, we distinguish $e$, the sample error, from $\varepsilon$ the error term from the true population model: 
  
  $$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,i} + ... + \beta_k x_{k,i} + \varepsilon_i$$
  
---


# CRM Assumptions

1. ***No perfect collinearity:*** the data are **not linearly dependent**, that is each variable provides new information on the outcome, and it is not a linear combination of the other variables.

--

2. ***Mean Independence:*** the mean of the residuals conditional on $x$ should be zero, $E[\varepsilon|x] = 0$. Notice that this also means that $Cov(\varepsilon,x) = 0$, i.e. that the errors and our explanatory variable(s) should be *uncorrelated*.

--

3. ***Independently and identically distributed:*** the data are drawn from a **random sample** of size $n$: observation $(x_i,y_i)$ comes from the exact same distribution, and is independent of observation $(x_j,y_j)$, for all $i\neq j$.

--

4. ***Homoskedasticity:*** the variance of the error term $\varepsilon$ is the same for each value of $x$: $Var(\varepsilon|x) = \sigma^2$.

--

5. ***Normally distributed errors:*** the error term is normally distributed, i.e. $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ 
  * This last assumption allows avoiding large sample approximations, but it is never used in practice since samples are sufficiently large $(n \ge 30)$.

---

# Exogeneity Assumption

The CRM assumption #2 is also know as the (strict) **exogeneity assumption**. 

* When this assumption is violated our estimate $b$ will be a ***biased*** estimate of $\beta$, i.e. $\mathop{\mathbb{E}}[b] \neq \beta$

--

* For example, imagine you are interested in the effect of education on wage

    $$\text{wage}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{educ}_i + \varepsilon_i$$
  
  * Under the exogeneity assumption $\beta_1$ denotes the causal effect of education in the population.

--

* Suppose there is *unobserved* ability $a_i$. 
  * High ability means higher wage.
  * It *also* means school is easier, and so $i$ selects into more schooling.

---

# Exogeneity Assumption 

* Given ability is *unobserved*,  $a_i$ goes into the error $\varepsilon_i$

--

* Our *ceteris paribus* assumption (all else equal) does not hold. 

--

* Then regressing the wage on education we will attribute to `educ` part of the effect on wages that is actually *caused* by ability $a_i$!

--

  * Remember the formula of the **omitted variable bias**:
  
  $$\textrm{OVB} = \{ \textrm{Relationship between } ability_i \textrm{ and } educ_i \} \\ * \{ \textrm{Effect of } ability_i \textrm{ in multiple regression} \}$$

--

  * Thus, we have:
  
  $$ \mathbb{E}(b_1) = \beta_1 + OVB > \beta_1$$ 

* *Interpretation*: taking repeated sample from the population and computing $b_1$ each time, we would **systematically overestimate** the effect of education on wage.

---

# Breaking the other assumptions

* You can find examples associated to the other assumptions in our [book](https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics/std-errors.html#class-reg)! 

* Takeaway: if assumptions violated, inference is invalid!

# Task 3.1 (10 min)

Let's go back to our question of returns to education and gender. 

1. Load the data `CPS1985` from the `AER` package and look back at the `help` to get the definition of each variable: `?CPS1985`

1. Create the `log_wage` variable equal to the log of `wage`.

1. Regress `log_wage` on `gender` and `education`, and save it as `reg1`. 

  * Interpret each coefficient.
  
  * Are the coefficients statistically significant? At which significance level? 

1. Regress the `log_wage` on `gender`, `education` and their interaction `gender*education`, save it as `reg2`. 

  * How do you interpret the coefficient associated to $female*education$?
  
  * Can we reject the nullity of this coefficient at the 5% level? At 10%?

# Task 3.2 (10 min)

1. Produce a scatterplot of the relationship between the log wage and the level of education.

1. Add the *regression line* with `geom_smooth`. What does this line represents?

1. Let's illustrate what the shaded area stands for.

  1. Draw one bootstrap sample from our `cps` data. 

  1. Regress the `log_wage` on `gender`, `education` and their interaction `gender*education`, save it as `reg_bootstrap`.

  1. From `reg_bootstrap` extract and save the value of the intercept for men as `intercept_men_bootstrap` and the value of the slope for men as `slope_men_bootstrap`. Do the same for women.

  1. Add both predicted lines from this bootstrap sample to the previous plot (*Hint*: use `geom_abline` (x2))
