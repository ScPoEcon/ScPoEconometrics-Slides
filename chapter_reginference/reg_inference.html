# Recap from last week

* ***Confidence interval***: a plausible range of value for the population parameter

* ***Hypothesis testing***: null hypothesis `\((H_0)\)` vs alternative hypothesis `\((H_A)\)`, (observed) test statistic, null distribution

* ***p-value***: probability of observing a test statistic as or more extreme than the observed test statistic assuming the null hypothesis is true.

# Back to class size and student performance

  * *small* and *regular* classes,
  * *Kindergarten* grade.

* What if we drew another random sample of schools from Tennessee and redid the experiment, would we find a different value for `\(b_1\)`?

# Regression Inference: `\(b_k\)` vs `\(\beta_k\)`

  * Just like the sample proportion `\(\hat{p}\)` from our pasta example!

... is an **estimate** about an unknown, **true population line**
`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1$$`

where `\(\beta_0, \beta_1\)` are the ***population parameters*** of interest.

--

* You will often find `\(\hat{\beta_k}\)` rather than `\(b_k\)`, both refer to sample estimate of `\(\beta_k\)`.

--

* Let's bring what we know about ***confidence intervals***, ***hypothesis testing*** and ***standard errors*** to bear on those `\(\hat{\beta_k}\)`!

# Understanding Regression Tables

Here is our `tidy` regression:

```r
library(broom)
tidy(lm(math ~ small, star_df))
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 5
##   term        estimate std.error statistic     p.value
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 (Intercept)   484.        1.15    421.   0          
## 2 smallTRUE       8.90      1.68      5.30 0.000000123
```




* There are 3 new columns here: `std.error`, `statistic`, `p.value`.

--

Entry | Meaning
----- | ----
`std. error` |  Standard error of `\(b_k\)`
`statistic` |  Observed test statistic associated to `\(H_0:\beta_k = 0,H_A:\beta_k \neq 0\)`
`p.value` |  p-value associated to `\(H_0:\beta_k = 0,H_A:\beta_k \neq 0\)`

--

* Let's focus on the `small` coefficient and make sense of each entry.

---

# Standard Error of `\(b_k\)`

&gt; ***Standard Error of `\(b_k\)`:*** Standard deviation of the sampling distribution of `\(b_k\)`.

--

Let's imagine we could redo the experiment 1000 times on 1000 different samples:

* We'd run 1000 regression and would get 1000 estimates of `\(\beta_k\)`, `\(b_k\)`.

--

* The standard error of `\(b_k\)` quantifies how much variation in `\(b_k\)` one would expect across (*an infinity of*) samples.

---

# Standard Error of `\(b_\textrm{small}\)`

* From the table, we get `\(\hat{\textrm{SE}}(b_\textrm{small}) = 1.68\)`
  
  * Notice that we write `\(\hat{\textrm{SE}}\)` and not `\({\textrm{SE}}\)` because 1.68 is an estimate of the real standard error of `\(b_\textrm{small}\)` we get from our sample.

--

* Let's simulate the sampling distribution of `\(b_\textrm{small}\)` to see where it comes from.

# Task 1 (10 min)

As we did for the sampling distribution of the proportion of *green pasta*, we want to generate the bootstrap distribution of `\(b_\textrm{small}\)`. 

1. Copy the loading and cleaning code from slide 3 and run it.

1. Generate the bootstrap distribution of `\(b_\textrm{small}\)` based on 1000 samples drawn from `star_df`. *Hint*: use the appropriate functions and arguments from the `infer` package so use the help pages.

1. Plot this simulated sampling distribution and compute mean and the standard error of `\(b_\textrm{small}\)`.

---

# Bootstrap Distribution

&lt;img src="reg_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

***standard error:*** 1.69 `\(\rightarrow\)` very close to the one in the table (1.68)!

---

# Testing `\(\beta_k = 0\)` vs `\(\beta_k \neq 0\)`

By default, the regression output provides the results associated with the following hypothesis test: 

`$$\begin{align}H_0:&amp; \beta_k = 0\\H_A:&amp; \beta_k \neq 0\end{align}$$`

--

* It allows to statistically test if there is a true relationship between the outcome and our regressor. 

--

* If `\(H_0\)` is true, there is **no** relationship between the outcome and our regressor. 

  * In that case observing `\(b_1 \neq 0\)` was just chance.

--

* If `\(H_0\)` is false, then there **is** a true relationship. 

--

* ***Important:*** This is a ***two-sided*** test!

---

# Test statistic and p-value

* As we saw in the previous lecture, to conduct such a test we need to:

--

  * Derive the sampling distribution of our **test statistic** (`statistic`) assuming `\(H_0\)` is true, i.e. the *null distribution*.
  
--

  * Quantify how extreme the **observed test statistic** is in this hypothetic world.

--

* Our *observed test statistic* (`statistic`) equals `\(\frac{b}{\hat{SE}(b)}\)`.

  * Why not just `\(b\)`? We'll come back and explain this formula later.

--

.pull-left[

```r
observed_stat = reg_star$coefficients[2]/sd(bootstrap_distrib$stat)
round(observed_stat,2)
```

```
## smallTRUE 
##      5.27
```
]

--

.pull-right[
* Quite close to the observed test statistic we got in the table: `statistic` = 5.3.
]
--

* The **p-value** measures the area outside of `\(\pm\)` *observed test statistic* under the *null distribution*.

--

* Finally, we check if we can reject `\(H_0\)` at the usual **significance levels**: `\(\alpha\)` = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01.

---

# Testing `\(\beta_\textrm{small} = 0\)` vs `\(\beta_\textrm{small} \neq 0\)`

* We will approximate the null distribution of `\(\frac{b_\textrm{small}}{\hat{SE}(b_\textrm{small})}\)` through a simulation exercise. 

--

* If there is no relationship between math score and class size, i.e. `\(H_0\)` is true, then *reshuffling* / *permuting* the values of `small` across students should play no role.

--

.pull-left[
* Let's generate 1000 permuted samples and compute `\(b_\textrm{small}\)` for each.


```r
null_distribution &lt;- star_df %&gt;% 
  specify(formula = math ~ small) %&gt;%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %&gt;% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %&gt;% 
  calculate(stat = "slope", order = c("TRUE","FALSE"))
```
]

--

.pull-right[

* We can compute the distribution of our test statistic `\(\frac{b_\textrm{small}}{\hat{SE}(b_\textrm{small})}\)` under the null:


```r
null_distribution &lt;- null_distribution %&gt;%
  mutate(test_stat = stat/sd(bootstrap_distrib$stat))
```

* Remember we got `\(\hat{SE}(b_\textrm{small})\)` = 1.69 from our bootstrap distribution.

* To decide if we reject `\(H_0\)`, recall we are considering a **two-sided test** here: *more extreme* means inferior to -5.27 **or** superior to 5.27. 

* Computing the *p-value* we get:


```r
p_value = mean(abs(null_distribution$test_stat) &gt;= observed_stat)
p_value
```

```
## [1] 0
```

--

* This is the same value as in the regression table.

--

* ***Question:*** Can we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level?

---

# Testing `\(\beta_\textrm{small} = 0\)` vs `\(\beta_\textrm{small} \neq 0\)`

* To decide if we reject `\(H_0\)`, recall we are considering a **two-sided test** here: *more extreme* means inferior to -5.27 **or** superior to 5.27. 

* Computing the *p-value* we get:


```r
p_value = mean(abs(null_distribution$test_stat) &gt;= observed_stat)
p_value
```

```
## [1] 0
```

* This is the same value as in the regression table.

* ***Answer:***

  * Since the *p-value* is equal to 0 it means that we would reject `\(H_0\)` at any significance level: the p-value would always be inferior to `\(\alpha\)`.
  * In other words, we can say that `\(b_\textrm{small}\)` is **statistically different from 0** at any significance level.
  * We also say that `\(b_\textrm{small}\)` is *statistically significant* (at any significance level).

# Regression Inference: Theory

* Up to now we presented simulation-based inference.

--

* The values reported by statistical packages in `R` are instead obtained from theory.

--

* Theoretical inference is based on **large sample approximations**.
  * One can show that sampling distributions *converge* to suitable distributions.
  
--
  
* Let's briefly look into the theory-based approach.

---

# Regression Inference: Theory

* Theory-based approach uses one fundamental result: the sampling distribution of the sample statistic `\(\frac{b - \beta}{\hat{\textrm{SE}(b)}}\)` *converges* to a ***standard normal distribution*** as the sample size gets larger and larger.

  * `\(\hat{\textrm{SE}(b)}\)` is the sample estimate of the standard deviation of `\(b\)`.
  * It is also obtained through a theoretical formula (which you can find in the [book](https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics/std-errors.html#se-theory)!) but we'll leave it aside.

--

* A ***standard normal distribution*** is a *normal distribution* with *mean* 0 and *standard deviation* 1.

--

* We don't need to simulate any sampling distribution here, we derive it from theory and use it to construct confidence intervals or to conduct hypothesis tests.

--

* Note that if `\(\frac{b - \beta}{\hat{\textrm{SE}(b)}}\)` *converges* to a ***standard normal distribution***, then `\(b\)` converges to a ***normal distribution*** with mean `\(\beta\)` and standard deviation `\(\hat{\textrm{SE}(b)}\)`.

---

# Standard Normal Distribution: A Refresher

.center[
&lt;img src="../img/photos/standard_normal_distrib.png" width="850px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---

# Theory-Based Inference: Confidence Interval

* Let's take the example of a 95% confidence interval.

--

* Since the sampling distribution of `\(b\)` is assumed to be normally shaped, we can use the ***95% rule of thumb*** about normal distributions.

--

* We know indeed that 95% of the values of a normal distribution lie within approximately 2 standard deviations of the mean (exactly 1.96).

--

* So, we can compute a 95% CI for `\(\beta\)` as: `\(\textrm{CI}_{95\%} = [ b \pm 1.96*\hat{\textrm{SE}}(b)]\)`

--

```
]

--

* This can easily be generalized to any confidence level by taking the appropriate quantile of the normal distribution.

---

class:inverse

# Task 2 (5 min)

1. Using the bootstrap distributed you generated in Task 1, compute the 95% confidence interval using the *percentile method*.

1. How similar is it to the confidence intervals obtained in the previous slide?

---

# Theory-Based Inference: Hypothesis Testing

* As we already mentioned, the default test that is conducted by any statistical software is:

`$$\begin{align}H_0:&amp; \beta_k = 0\\H_A:&amp; \beta_k \neq 0\end{align}$$`
--

* So, **under the null hypothesis** we get from theory that the sampling distribution of `\(\frac{b}{\hat{\textrm{SE}(b)}}\)` will be a standard normal distribution.

--

* As such we can directly compare the observed test statistic `\(\frac{b}{\hat{\textrm{SE}(b)}}\)` to the *standard normal distribution* which is the **null distribution** of our test statistic. 

--

* The ***p-value*** associated to our test is then equal to the area of the *standard normal distribution* outside `\(\pm\)` the observed value of `\(\frac{b}{\hat{\textrm{SE}(b)}}\)`.

--

* Common rule of thumb: if the *estimate* is ***twice the size of the standard error***, then it is significant at the 5% level. Why?

---

# Classical Regression Model

---

# Classical Regression Model

* Whether the inference is made from theory or simulations, some assumptions have to be met for this inference to be valid.

* The set of assumptions needed defines the *Classical Regression Model* (CRM).

--

* Before delving into these assumptions, let's see the small but important modifications we apply to our model (back to [*lecture 4*](https://raw.githack.com/ScPoEcon/ScPoEconometrics-Slides/master/chapter3/chapter3.html#1)):

--

  * We already mentioned the distinction between the sample estimate `\(b_k\)` (or `\(\hat{\beta_k}\)`) and the population parameter `\(\beta_k\)`.

--

  * In the same way, we distinguish `\(e\)`, the sample error, from `\(\varepsilon\)` the error term from the true population model: 
  
  `$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,i} + ... + \beta_k x_{k,i} + \varepsilon_i$$`
  
---


# CRM Assumptions

1. ***No perfect collinearity:*** the data are **not linearly dependent**, that is each variable provides new information on the outcome, and it is not a linear combination of the other variables.

--

2. ***Mean Independence:*** the mean of the residuals conditional on `\(x\)` should be zero, `\(E[\varepsilon|x] = 0\)`. Notice that this also means that `\(Cov(\varepsilon,x) = 0\)`, i.e. that the errors and our explanatory variable(s) should be *uncorrelated*.

--

3. ***Independently and identically distributed:*** the data are drawn from a **random sample** of size `\(n\)`: observation `\((x_i,y_i)\)` comes from the exact same distribution, and is independent of observation `\((x_j,y_j)\)`, for all `\(i\neq j\)`.

--

4. ***Homoskedasticity:*** the variance of the error term `\(\varepsilon\)` is the same for each value of `\(x\)`: `\(Var(\varepsilon|x) = \sigma^2\)`.

--

5. ***Normally distributed errors:*** the error term is normally distributed, i.e. `\(\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)\)` 
  * This last assumption allows avoiding large sample approximations, but it is never used in practice since samples are sufficiently large `\((n \ge 30)\)`.

&lt;img src="reg_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Exogeneity Assumption

The CRM assumption #2 is also know as the (strict) **exogeneity assumption**. 

* When this assumption is violated our estimate `\(b\)` will be a ***biased*** estimate of `\(\beta\)`, i.e. `\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}}[b] \neq \beta\)`

--

* For example, imagine you are interested in the effect of education on wage

    `$$\text{wage}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{educ}_i + \varepsilon_i$$`
  
  * Under the exogeneity assumption `\(\beta_1\)` denotes the causal effect of education in the population.

--

* Suppose there is *unobserved* ability `\(a_i\)`. 
  * High ability means higher wage.
  * It *also* means school is easier, and so `\(i\)` selects into more schooling.

---

# Exogeneity Assumption 

* Given ability is *unobserved*,  `\(a_i\)` goes into the error `\(\varepsilon_i\)`

--

* Our *ceteris paribus* assumption (all else equal) does not hold. 

--

* Then regressing the wage on education we will attribute to `educ` part of the effect on wages that is actually *caused* by ability `\(a_i\)`!

--

  * Remember the formula of the **omitted variable bias**:
  
  `$$\textrm{OVB} = \{ \textrm{Relationship between } ability_i \textrm{ and } educ_i \} \\ * \{ \textrm{Effect of } ability_i \textrm{ in multiple regression} \}$$`

--

  * Thus, we have:
  
  $$ \mathbb{E}(b_1) = \beta_1 + OVB &gt; \beta_1$$ 

* *Interpretation*: taking repeated sample from the population and computing `\(b_1\)` each time, we would **systematically overestimate** the effect of education on wage.

---

# Breaking the other assumptions

* You can find examples associated to the other assumptions in our [book](https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics/std-errors.html#class-reg)! 

* Takeaway: if assumptions violated, inference is invalid!

# Task 3.1 (10 min)

Let's go back to our question of returns to education and gender. 

1. Load the data `CPS1985` from the `AER` package and look back at the `help` to get the definition of each variable: `?CPS1985`

1. Create the `log_wage` variable equal to the log of `wage`.

1. Regress `log_wage` on `gender` and `education`, and save it as `reg1`. 

  * Interpret each coefficient.
  
  * Are the coefficients statistically significant? At which significance level? 

1. Regress the `log_wage` on `gender`, `education` and their interaction `gender*education`, save it as `reg2`. 

  * How do you interpret the coefficient associated to `\(female*education\)`?
  
  * Can we reject the nullity of this coefficient at the 5% level? At 10%?

# Task 3.2 (10 min)

1. Produce a scatterplot of the relationship between the log wage and the level of education.

1. Add the *regression line* with `geom_smooth`. What does this line represents?

1. Let's illustrate what the shaded area stands for.

  1. Draw one bootstrap sample from our `cps` data. 

  1. Regress the `log_wage` on `gender`, `education` and their interaction `gender*education`, save it as `reg_bootstrap`.

  1. From `reg_bootstrap` extract and save the value of the intercept for men as `intercept_men_bootstrap` and the value of the slope for men as `slope_men_bootstrap`. Do the same for women.

  1. Add both predicted lines from this bootstrap sample to the previous plot (*Hint*: use `geom_abline` (x2))
