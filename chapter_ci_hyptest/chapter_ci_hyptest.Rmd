.pull-right[

* In real life we only get to take ***one*** sample from the population (not ***1000***!).

* Also, we obviously don't know the true population parameter, that's what we are interested in!

* So what on earth was all of this good for? Fun only?! `r emo::ji("anguished")`

* Even unobserved, we ***know*** that the sampling distribution does exist, and even better, we know how it behaves!

* Let's see what we can do with this...

# From Point Estimates to Confidence Intervals

* Until now, we have only estimated ***point estimates*** from our samples: *sample means*, *sample proportions*, *regression coefficients*, etc.

--

* We know that this ***sample statistic*** differs from the ***true population parameter*** due to ***sampling variation***. 

--

* Rather than a point estimate, we could give a ***range of plausible values*** for the population parameter.

--

* This is precisely what a ***confidence interval*** (CI) provides.

---

# Constructing Confidence Intervals 

There are several approaches to constructing confidence intervals:
    
  1. *Theory*: use mathematical formulas (***Central Limit Theorem***) to derive the sampling distribution of our point estimate under certain conditions $\rightarrow$ ***what `R` does under the hood!***

--

  1. *Simulation*: use the ***bootstrapping*** method to *reconstruct* the sampling distribution of our point estimate
    
--
    
We'll focus on simulation to give you the intuition and come back to the maths approach next week.

--

In practice, you ***don't*** need to compute your confidence intervals using *bootstrap*, `R` uses statistical theory to do it for you.

---

# Back to Pasta

* As in real life, imagine we had access to *only one random sample* from our bowl of pasta.

--

* How could we study the effect of sampling variation with a single sample? `r emo::ji("point_right")` ***bootstrap resampling with replacement***!

--

* Let's start by drawing one random sample of size $n = 50$ from our bowl.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
bowl <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/qpjsk0rfgc0gx80/pasta.csv?dl=1")

set.seed(1234)

sample_size = 50

my_sample = bowl %>%
  mutate(color = as.factor(ifelse(color == "green","green","non-green"))) %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = sample_size) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(pasta_ID, color) %>%
  arrange(pasta_ID)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
bowl <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/qpjsk0rfgc0gx80/pasta.csv?dl=1")

my_sample = bowl %>%
  mutate(color = ifelse(color == "green","green","non-green")) %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 50) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(pasta_ID, color)
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
head(my_sample,3)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
p_hat = mean(my_sample$color == "green")
p_hat
```

The proportion of green pasta in this sample is: $\hat{p} = `r p_hat`$.
]

---

# Resampling our Pasta Sample

How do we obtain a ***bootstrap sample***?

--
  
  1. Randomly pick ***one*** pasta from the sample and record the associated color.
  
--
  
  1. Put this pasta back in the sample.
  
--
  
  1. Repeat steps 1 and 2 49 times, i.e. ***until the new sample is of the same size as the original sample***.

--

  1. Compute the proportion of green pasta in the bootstrap sample.
  
--

This procedure is called ***resampling with replacement***:

  * *resampling*: drawing repeated samples from a sample.
  * *with replacement*: each time the drawn pasta is put back in the sample.

---

# Resampling our Pasta Sample

.pull-left[

Here is one bootstrap sample: 

```{r}
one_bootstrap = my_sample %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, replace = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(pasta_ID)

head(one_bootstrap, 8)

nrow(one_bootstrap)
```
]

--

.pull-right[

Several pasta have been drawn multiple times. How come?

What's the proportion of green pasta in this bootstrap sample?

```{r}
mean(one_bootstrap$color == "green")
```

The proportion is different than that in our sample! This is due to resampling ***with replacement***.

What if we repeated this resampling procedure many times? Would the proportion be the same each time?
]

  
---

# Obtaining the Bootstrap Distribution

* Let's repeat the resampling procedure 1,000 times: there will be 1,000 bootstrap samples and 1,000 bootstrap estimates!

--

.pull-left[
We use the `infer` package to ease the bootstrapping procedure.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
bootstrap_distrib = my_sample %>% # take my random sample
  specify(response = color, success = "green") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop")

percentile_95ci = get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_distrib, level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_95lb = percentile_95ci[[1]]
percentile_95ub = percentile_95ci[[2]]

```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(infer)

bootstrap_distrib = my_sample %>%
  # specify the variable and level of interest
  specify(response = color, success = "green") %>% 
  # generate 1000 bootstrap samples 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  # calculate the proportion of green pasta for each
  calculate(stat = "prop") 
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Here are the first 6 rows:

```{r}
head(bootstrap_distrib)

nrow(bootstrap_distrib)
```

Let's visualize this sampling variation!

]

---

# Bootstrap Distribution

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.height = 4.75, fig.width = 8}
boot_distrib_plot = bootstrap_distrib %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(boundary = 0.39, binwidth = 0.02, col = "white", fill = "darkgreen") +
  labs(x = "Proportion of green pasta",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14)
boot_distrib_plot
```

--

The ***bootstrap distribution*** is an approximation of the ***sampling distribution***.

---

# Bootstrap Distribution with Mean

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.height = 4.75, fig.width = 8}
boot_distrib_plot +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(bootstrap_distrib$stat), linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  annotate("text", x = 0.375, y = 127, label = "bootstrap distribution mean", size = 4)
```

--

The ***bootstrap distribution*** mean is very close to the original sample proportion.

---

# Bootstrap Distribution with Mean

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.height = 4.75, fig.width = 8}
boot_distrib_plot +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(bootstrap_distrib$stat), linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  annotate("text", x = 0.375, y = 127, label = "bootstrap distribution mean", size = 4)
```

Let's use this ***bootstrap distribution*** to construct confidence intervals!

---

# Understanding Confidence Intervals

* Analogy with fishing:

  * *point estimate*: fishing with a spear.
  
--
  
  * *confidence interval*: fishing with a net.

--

* In our case the fish is the true proportion of pasta in the bowl that are green $(p)$.

--

* The *point estimate* would be the proportion of green pasta obtained from a random sample $(\hat{p})$.

--

* The *confidence interval*: from the previous bootstrap distribution, ***where do most proportions lie?***

--

* Method for confidence interval construction: ***percentile method***.

--

* Requires specifying a ***confidence level***: 90%, 95%, and 99% are the most common. 

---

# Percentile Method: 95% Confidence Interval

* Construct a confidence interval as the middle 95% of values of the bootstrap distribution.

--

* For that, we compute the 2.5% and 97.5% percentile:

.pull-left[
```{r}
quantile(bootstrap_distrib$stat,0.025)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
quantile(bootstrap_distrib$stat,0.975)
```
]

* Therefore the 95% confidence interval is $[`r round(percentile_95lb,2)` ; `r  round(percentile_95ub,2)`]$.

* It is a ***range*** of values.

--

* Let's see this confidence interval on the sampling distribution.

---

# Percentile Method: 95% Confidence Interval Visually

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.height = 4.75, fig.width = 8}
percentile_95lb = quantile(bootstrap_distrib$stat,0.025)
percentile_95ub = quantile(bootstrap_distrib$stat,0.975)

boot_distrib_plot_ci = boot_distrib_plot +
  geom_vline(xintercept = percentile_95lb, linetype = "dashed", size = 1.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = percentile_95ub, linetype = "dashed", size = 1.5) +
  annotate("rect", xmin=percentile_95lb, xmax=percentile_95ub, ymin=0, ymax=Inf, fill = "#d90502", alpha=0.4)
boot_distrib_plot_ci
```

--

Does the interval contain the true population proportion?

---

# Percentile Method: 95% Confidence Interval Visually

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.height = 4.75, fig.width = 8}
p = mean(bowl$color == "green")

boot_distrib_plot_ci +
  geom_vline(xintercept = p, col = "black", size = 1.25) +
  annotate("text", x = 0.56, y = 125, label = "population proportion", size = 4)
```

--

True population parameter is indeed in our 95% interval! Will it always be?

---

# Interpreting a 95% Confidence Interval

Let's repeatedly draw 100 different samples from our `bowl` and for each sample compute the associated 95% CI using the percentile method.

How many confidence intervals contain the true parameter? Why?

---

# Interpreting a 95% Confidence Interval

> *Precise interpretation:* If we repeated our sampling procedure ***a large number of times***, we ***expect about 95%*** of the resulting confidence intervals to capture the value of the population parameter.

In other words, 95% of the time, the 95% confidence interval will contain the true population parameter.

--

> *Short-hand interpretation:* We are ***95% “confident”*** that a 95% confidence interval captures the value of the population parameter.

--

***Questions:*** 

  * How does the width of the confidence interval change as the ***confidence level*** increases?
  
  * How does the width of the confidence interval change as the ***sample size*** increases?

# Interpreting a 95% Confidence Interval

> *Short-hand interpretation:* We are ***95% “confident”*** that a 95% confidence interval captures the value of the population parameter.

***Impact of confidence level:*** the greater the confidence level, the wider the confidence intervals.

  * *Intuition*: a greater confidence level means the confidence interval needs to contain the true population parameter more often, and thus needs to be wider to ensure this.
  
--

***Impact of sample size:*** the greater the sample size, the narrower the confidence intervals.

  * *Inutuition*: a larger sample size leads to less sampling variation and therefore a narrower boostrap distribution, which in turn leads to thiner confidence intervals.
  
---

# From Confidence Intervals to Hypothesis Testing

* *Confidence intervals* can be thought of as an extension of *point estimation*.

--

* What if we want to ***compare*** a sample statistic for two groups?
  
  * *Example*: differences in average wages between men and women. Are the observed differences ***significant***?
  
--

* These comparisons are the realm of ***hypothesis testing***.

--

* Just like confidence intervals, hypothesis tests are used to make claims about a population based on information from a sample.

* However, we’ll see that the framework for making such inferences is slightly different.

# Is There Gender Discrimination In Promotions?

* We will use data from an [article](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/39f6/d40e907ff08af4ddd3280c2ceee55ee1ddb6.pdf) published in the *Journal of Applied Psychology* in 1974 which investigated whether female employees at banks were discriminated against.

* 48 (male) supervisors were given *identical* candidate CVs, differing only with respect to the first name, which was male or female.

  * Each CV was "*in the form of a memorandum requesting a decision on the promotion of an employee to the position of branch manager.*"

--

* ***Hypothesis*** we want to test: *Is there gender discrimination?*

# Sampling Variation

* In our hypothetical world, the difference in promotion rates was only 4.2 percentage points.

* Can we answer our initial question about the existence of gender discrimination now?

--

* No, we must investigate the role of ***sampling variation***!

  * What if we reshuffle once again, how different from 4.2%p (*percentage points*) would the difference be?

--
  
  * In other words, how representative of that hypothetical world is 4.2%p?
  
--
  
  * How likely is a 29%p difference to occur in such a world?
  
--

* We need to know about the whole sampling distribution under the *no discrimination* hypothesis.

--

* How? Just by redoing the reshuffling a large number of times, and computing the difference each time.

How ***likely*** is it to observe a 0.292 difference in a world with no discrimination?

---

# What did we just do?

* We just demonstrated the statistical procedure known as ***hypothesis testing*** using a ***permutation test***.

--

* The question is how likely the observed difference in promotion rates is to occur in a hypothetical universe with no discrimination.

--

* We concluded ***rather not***, i.e. we tended to ***reject*** the no discrimination hypothesis.

--

* Let's introduce the formal framework of hypothesis testing now.

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions

* A ***hypothesis test*** consists of a test between ***two competing hypotheses*** about the population parameter:

--

  * The ***null hypothesis*** $(H_0)$: generally hypothesis of no difference;
--
  
  * The ***alternative hypothesis*** $(H_A \textrm{or }H_1)$: the research hypothesis.

--

* In the previous example:
$$\begin{align}H_0&: p_m - p_f = 0\\H_A&: p_m - p_f > 0,\end{align}$$
where $p_m =$ promotion rate of men, and $p_f =$ promotion rate of women.

--

  * Here, we considered a *one-sided* alternative, stating that $p_m > p_f$, i.e. women are discriminated against.
  * The *two-sided* formulation is just $H_A: p_m - p_f \neq 0$.

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions

* ***Test statistic***: *point estimate/sample statistic* formula used for hypothesis testing. 

--

  * *In our previous case*: difference in sample proportions $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f$.

--

* ***Observed test statistic***: value of the test statistic that we observed in real life.

--

  * *In our previous case*: observed difference $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f = 0.292 = 29.2$ percentage points.
  
--

* ***Null distribution***: sampling distribution of the test statistic *assuming the null hypothesis $H_0$ is true*.

--
  *  *In our previous case*: All the possible values that $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f$ can take assuming there is no discrimination.
  * That's the distribution we have seen just before.

* How *surprised* are we that we observed a difference in promotions rates of 0.292 in our sample assuming $H_0$ is true, that is a world without discrimination? Very surprised? Kind of surprised?

--

* What do we mean by ***more extreme***?

  * Defined in terms of the alternative hypothesis: in this case, men are ***more likely*** to be promoted than women. Therefore, ***more extreme*** in our case means observing a difference in promotion rates ***greater than 0.292***.

--

* ***Interpretation***: the lower the p-value, the *less consistent our null hypothesis is with the observed statistic*.

--

* When do we decide to ***reject*** $H_0$ or not?

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions

* To decide wether we reject $H_0$ or not, we set a ***significance level*** for the test.

--

* ***Significance level $(\alpha)$:*** acts as a *cutoff* on the p-value.

  * Common values are $\alpha = 0.01$, $0.05$, or $0.1$.

--

* ***Decision***:
  * If the p-value falls ***below the cutoff $\alpha$***, we "***reject the null hypothesis at the significance level $\alpha$***."

--

  * Alternatively, if the p-value if ***greater than $\alpha$***, we say that we "***fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ at the significance level $\alpha$***."

--

* ***Interpretation***: If what we observe *is too unlikely to happen* under the null hypothesis, it means that this hypothesis is ***likely to be false***.

--

* Let's illustrate how it works in our example.

# Visualizing the P-value

```{r,fig.height = 4.75, fig.width = 8, echo = FALSE}
obs_diff_prop <- promotions %>%
  specify(decision ~ gender, success = "promoted") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("male", "female"))

visualize(null_distribution, bins = 10, fill = "#d90502") + 
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_prop,
                size = 0.5,
                direction = "right", 
                fill = "black") +
  labs(x = "Differences in sample proportions (male - female)",
       y = "Frequency") +
  xlim(-0.4, 0.4)+
  theme_bw(base_size = 14) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.292, size = 1.25) +
  annotate("text", x = 0.19, y = 485, label = "observed test statistic", size = 4)
```

The shaded area correponds to the p-value!

# Obtaining the p-value and Deciding

* Recall the definition of the p-value: ***probability of observing a test statistic *just as or more extreme* than the one we obtained, assuming the null hypothesis $H_0$ is true.***

--

```{r}
p_value <- mean(null_distribution$stat >= 0.292)
p_value
```

* In a world without discrimination, we would get $\hat{p_m} - \hat{p_f}$ superior (or equal) to 0.292 only `r 100*p_value`% of the time. 
--

* So, we can reject $H_0$, i.e. the absence of discrimination, at the 5% significance level.

  * We also say that $\hat{p_m} - \hat{p_f} = 0.292$ is ***statistically significantly different from 0*** at the 5% level. 
 
--

* ***Question***: Suppose we had set $\alpha = 0.01 = 1\%$, would we have rejected the absence of discrimination at this level? 

---

# Testing Errors

Working with probabilities implies that sometimes, we make **errors**.

--

* A 29%p difference may be *unlikely* under $H_0$, but that **doesn't mean it's *impossible* to occur**.

  * In fact, such a difference (or higher) would occur (approximately) in 0.007% of cases.
  
--

* So, it may happen that we sometimes reject $H_0$, when in fact it was true.

  * Setting 5% significance level, you make sure it won't happen more than 5% of the time. 

---

# Testing Errors

In hypothesis testing, there are ***two types of errors***:

.pull-left[

![:scale 100%](../img/photos/gt_error_table_ht.png)

]

.pull-right[

***Type I error***: reject the null hypothesis when in fact it was true. ***false positive***
  
***Type II error***: don't reject the null hypothesis when in fact it was false. ***false negative***

]

* In practice, we choose the frequency of a Type I error by setting $\alpha$ and try to minimize the type II error.

---

# How does all of this relate to regression analysis? 

* Now you have all the tools to make ***statistical inference*** for real!

--

* Regression analysis is based on a ***sample*** of data.

--

* So your ***regression coefficient*** is subject to ***sampling variation***, it's not the true population coefficient.

--

* ***Question***: Is the estimated effect statistically significantly different from some value $z$?
