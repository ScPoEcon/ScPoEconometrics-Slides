# Recap from last week

* Sampling: ***sampling variation*** and ***sampling distributions***

* population, population parameter, sample statistic or point estimate, random sampling

* ***Unbiased estimator***: `\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}}[\hat{p}] = p\)`

* ***Central Limit Theorem***: as sample size increases, sampling distribution is more ***normally distributed***, centered around the ***population parameter***, and has a smaller ***standard error***

--

## Today: Deeper dive into ***statistical inference*** &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[
[1]: This lecture is based on the wonderful [confidence interval](https://moderndive.com/8-confidence-intervals.html) and [hypothesis testing](https://moderndive.com/9-hypothesis-testing.html) chapters of [ModernDive](https://moderndive.com/)]

* Process of making claims about a population based on information from a sample

* *Confidence intervals*: providing plausible ***range*** of values

* *Hypothesis testing*: comparing statistics between groups

# Back to reality (there goes gravity 😉)

.pull-right[

* In real life we only get to take ***one*** sample from the population (not ***1000***!).

* Also, we obviously don't know the true population parameter, that's what we are interested in!

* So what on earth was all of this good for? Fun only?! 😧

]

--

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

* Even unobserved, we ***know*** that the sampling distribution does exist, and even better, we know how it behaves!

* Let's see what we can do with this...

# From Point Estimates to Confidence Intervals

* Until now, we have only estimated ***point estimates*** from our samples: *sample means*, *sample proportions*, *regression coefficients*, etc.

--

* We know that this ***sample statistic*** differs from the ***true population parameter*** due to ***sampling variation***. 

--

* Rather than a point estimate, we could give a ***range of plausible values*** for the population parameter.

--

* This is precisely what a ***confidence interval*** (CI) provides.

---

# Constructing Confidence Intervals 

There are several approaches to constructing confidence intervals:
    
  1. *Theory*: use mathematical formulas (***Central Limit Theorem***) to derive the sampling distribution of our point estimate under certain conditions.

--

  1. *Simulation*: use the ***bootstrapping*** method to *reconstruct* the sampling distribution of our point estimate.
    
--
    
We'll focus on simulation to give you the intuition and come back to the maths approach next week.

---

# Back to Pasta

* As in real life, imagine we had access to *only one random sample* from our bowl of past.

--

* How could we study the effect of sampling variation with a single sample? 👉 ***bootstrap resampling with replacement***!

--

* Let's start by drawing one random sample of size `\(n = 50\)` from our bowl.




```r
bowl &lt;- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/qpjsk0rfgc0gx80/pasta.csv?dl=1")

my_sample = bowl %&gt;%
  mutate(color = as.factor(ifelse(color == "green","green","non-green"))) %&gt;%
  rep_sample_n(size = 50) %&gt;%
  ungroup() %&gt;%
  select(pasta_ID, color)
```

.pull-left[

```r
head(my_sample,3)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   pasta_ID color    
##      &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    
## 1        4 non-green
## 2       41 non-green
## 3       79 non-green
```
]

--

.pull-right[

```r
p_hat = mean(my_sample$color == "green")
p_hat
```

```
## [1] 0.46
```

The proportion of green pasta in this sample is: `\(\hat{p} = 0.46\)`.
]

---

# Resampling our Pasta Sample

How do we obtain a ***bootstrap sample***?

--
  
  1. Randomly pick ***one*** pasta from the sample and record the associated color.
  
--
  
  1. Put this pasta back in the sample.
  
--
  
  1. Repeat steps 1 and 2 49 times, i.e. ***until the new sample is of the same size as the original sample***.

--

  1. Compute the proportion of green pasta in the bootstrap sample.
  
--

This procedure is called ***resampling with replacement***:

  * *resampling*: drawing repeated samples from a sample.
  * *with replacement*: each time the drawn pasta is put back in the sample.

---

# Resampling our Pasta Sample

.pull-left[

Here is one bootstrap sample: 


```r
one_bootstrap = my_sample %&gt;%
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, replace = TRUE) %&gt;%
  arrange(pasta_ID)

head(one_bootstrap, 8)
```

```
## # A tibble: 8 x 3
## # Groups:   replicate [1]
##   replicate pasta_ID color    
##       &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    
## 1         1        4 non-green
## 2         1       41 non-green
## 3         1       41 non-green
## 4         1       79 non-green
## 5         1       79 non-green
## 6         1      103 non-green
## 7         1      103 non-green
## 8         1      103 non-green
```

```r
nrow(one_bootstrap)
```

```
## [1] 50
```
]

--

.pull-right[

Several pasta have been drawn multiple times. How come?

What's the proportion of green pasta in this bootstrap sample?


```r
mean(one_bootstrap$color == "green")
```

```
## [1] 0.4
```

The proportion is different than that in our sample! This is due to resampling ***with replacement***.

What if we repeated this resampling procedure many times? Would the proportion be the same each time?
]

# Obtaining the Bootstrap Distribution

* Let's repeat the resampling procedure 1000 times: there will be 1000 bootstrap samples and 1000 bootstrap estimates!

--

.pull-left[
We use the `infer` package to ease the bootstrapping procedure.





```r
library(infer)

bootstrap_distrib = my_sample %&gt;%
  # specify the variable and level of interest
  specify(response = color, success = "green") %&gt;% 
  # generate 1000 bootstrap samples 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %&gt;% 
  # calculate the proportion of green pasta for each
  calculate(stat = "prop") 
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Here are the first 6 rows:


```r
head(bootstrap_distrib)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 2
##   replicate  stat
##       &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1         1  0.44
## 2         2  0.36
## 3         3  0.46
## 4         4  0.46
## 5         5  0.52
## 6         6  0.52
```

```r
nrow(bootstrap_distrib)
```

```
## [1] 1000
```

Let's visualize this sampling variation!

# Bootstrap Distribution

&lt;img src="CI_and_hypothesis_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The ***bootstrap distribution*** is an approximation of the ***sampling distribution***.

---

# Bootstrap Distribution with Mean

&lt;img src="CI_and_hypothesis_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The ***bootstrap distribution*** mean is very close to the original sample proportion.

---

# Bootstrap Distribution with Mean

&lt;img src="CI_and_hypothesis_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Let's use this ***bootstrap distribution*** to construct confidence intervals!

---

# Understanding Confidence Intervals

* Analogy with fishing:

  * *point estimate*: fishing with a spear.
  
--
  
  * *confidence interval*: fishing with a net.

--

* In our case the fish is the true proportion of pasta in the bowl that are green `\((p)\)`.

--

* The *point estimate* would be the proportion of green pasta obtained from a random sample `\((\hat{p})\)`.

--

* The *confidence interval*: from the previous bootstrap distribution, ***where do most proportions lie?***

--

* Method for confidence interval construction: ***percentile method***.

--

* Requires specifying a ***confidence level***: 90%, 95%, and 99% are the most common. 

---

# Percentile Method: 95% Confidence Interval

* Construct a confidence interval as the middle 95% of values of the bootstrap distribution.

--

* For that, we compute the 2.5% and 97.5% percentile:

.pull-left[

```r
quantile(bootstrap_distrib$stat,0.025)
```

```
## 2.5% 
## 0.32
```
]
.pull-right[

```r
quantile(bootstrap_distrib$stat,0.975)
```

```
## 97.5% 
##   0.6
```
]

* Therefore the 95% confidence interval is `\([0.32 ; 0.6]\)`.

* It is a ***range*** of values.

--

* Let's see this confidence interval on the sampling distribution.

---

# Percentile Method: 95% Confidence Interval Visually

&lt;img src="CI_and_hypothesis_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

Does the interval contain the true population proportion?

---

# Percentile Method: 95% Confidence Interval Visually

&lt;img src="CI_and_hypothesis_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

True population parameter is indeed in our 95% interval! Will it always be?

---

# Interpreting a 95% Confidence Interval

Let's repeatedly draw 100 different samples from our `bowl` and for each sample compute the associated 95% CI using the percentile method.

--

&lt;img src="CI_and_hypothesis_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

How many confidence intervals contain the true parameter? Why?

---

# Interpreting a 95% Confidence Interval

&gt; *Precise interpretation:* If we repeated our sampling procedure ***a large number of times***, we ***expect about 95%*** of the resulting confidence intervals to capture the value of the population parameter.

In other words, 95% of the time, the 95% confidence interval will contain the true population parameter.

--

&gt; *Short-hand interpretation:* We are ***95% “confident”*** that a 95% confidence interval captures the value of the population parameter.

--

***Questions:*** 

  * How does the width of the confidence interval change as the ***confidence level*** increases?
  
  * How does the width of the confidence interval change as the ***sample size*** increases?
  
---

# Interpreting a 95% Confidence Interval

&gt; *Precise interpretation:* If we repeated our sampling procedure ***a large number of times***, we ***expect about 95%*** of the resulting confidence intervals to capture the value of the population parameter.

In other words, 95% of the time, the 95% confidence interval will contain the true population parameter.

&gt; *Short-hand interpretation:* We are ***95% “confident”*** that a 95% confidence interval captures the value of the population parameter.

***Impact of confidence level:*** the greater the confidence level, the wider the confidence intervals.

  * *Intuition*: a greater confidence level means the confidence interval needs to contain the true population parameter more often, and thus needs to be wider to ensure this.
  
--

***Impact of sample size:*** the greater the confidence level, the wider the confidence intervals.

  * *Inutuition*: a larger sample size leads to less sampling variation and therefore a narrower boostrap distribution, which in turn leads to thiner confidence intervals.
  
---

# From Confidence Intervals to Hypothesis Testing

* *Confidence intervals* can be thought of as an extension of *point estimation*.

--

* What if we want to ***compare*** a sample statistic for two groups?
  
  * *Example*: differences in average wages between men and women. Are the observed differences ***significant***?
  
--

* These comparisons are the realm of ***hypothesis testing***.

--

* Just like confidence intervals, hypothesis tests are used to make claims about a population based on information from a sample.

* However, we’ll see that the framework for making such inferences is slightly different.

# Is There Gender Discrimination In Promotions?

* We will use data from an [article](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/39f6/d40e907ff08af4ddd3280c2ceee55ee1ddb6.pdf) published in the *Journal of Applied Psychology* in 1974 which investigated whether female employees at banks were discriminated against.

* 48 (male) supervisors were given *identical* candidate CVs, differing only with respect to the first name, which was male or female.

  * Each CV was "*in the form of a memorandum requesting a decision on the promotion of an employee to the position of branch manager.*"

--

* ***Hypothesis*** we want to test: *Is there gender discrimination?*

--

.pull-left[
* The data from the experiment are provided in the `promotions` dataset from the `moderndive` package.

# Sampling Variation

* In our hypothetical world, the difference in promotion rates was only 4.2 percentage points.

* Can we answer our initial question about the existence of gender discrimination now?

--

* No, we must investigate the role of ***sampling variation***!

  * What if we reshuffle once again, how different from 4.2%p would the difference be?

--
  
  * In other words, how representative of that hypothetical world is 4.2%p?
  
--
  
  * How likely is a 29%p difference to occur in such a world?
  
--

* We need to know about the whole sampling distribution under the *no discrimination* hypothesis.

--

* How? Just by redoing the reshuffling a large number of times, and computing the difference each time.

How ***likely*** is it to observe a 0.292 difference in a world with no discrimination?

---

# What did we just do?

* We just demonstrated the statistical procedure known as ***hypothesis testing*** using a ***permutation test***.

--

* The question is how likely the observed difference in promotion rates is to occur in a hypothetical universe with no discrimination.

--

* We concluded ***rather not***, i.e. we tended to ***reject*** the no discrimination hypothesis.

--

* Let's introduce the formal framework of hypothesis testing now.

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions

* A ***hypothesis test*** consists of a test between ***two competing hypotheses*** about the population parameter:

--

  * The ***null hypothesis*** `\((H_0)\)`: generally hypothesis of no difference;
--
  
  * The ***alternative hypothesis*** `\((H_A \textrm{or }H_1)\)`: the research hypothesis.

--

* In the previous example:
`$$\begin{align}H_0&amp;: p_m - p_f = 0\\H_A&amp;: p_m - p_f &gt; 0,\end{align}$$`
where `\(p_m =\)` promotion rate of men, and `\(p_f =\)` promotion rate of women.

--

  * Here, we considered a *one-sided* alternative, stating that `\(p_m &gt; p_f\)`, i.e. women are discriminated against.
  * The *two-sided* formulation is just `\(H_A: p_m - p_f \neq 0\)`.

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions

* ***Test statistic***: *point estimate/sample statistic* formula used for hypothesis testing. 

--

  * *In our previous case*: difference in sample proportions `\(\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f\)`.

--

* ***Observed test statistic***: value of the test statistic that we observed in real life.

--

  * *In our previous case*: observed difference `\(\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f = 0.292 = 29.2\)` percentage points.
  
--

* ***Null distribution***: sampling distribution of the test statistic *assuming the null hypothesis `\(H_0\)` is true*.

--
  *  *In our previous case*: All the possible values that `\(\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f\)` can take assuming there is no discrimination.
  * That's the distribution we have seen just before.
 
---

# Null Distribution

&lt;img src="CI_and_hypothesis_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions

&gt; ### ***p-value:*** probability of observing a test statistic *just as or more extreme* than the one we obtained, assuming the null hypothesis `\(H_0\)` is true. 🤔

--

* How *surprised* are we that we observed a difference in promotions rates of 0.292 in our sample assuming `\(H_0\)` is true, that is a world without discrimination? Very surprised? Kind of surprised?

--

* What do we mean by ***more extreme***?

  * Defined in terms of the alternative hypothesis: in this case, men are ***more likely*** to be promoted than women. Therefore, ***more extreme*** in our case means observing a difference in promotion rates ***greater than 0.292***.

--

* ***Interpretation***: the lower the p-value, the *less consistent our null hypothesis is with the observed statistic*.

--

* When do we decide to ***reject*** `\(H_0\)` or not?

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions

* To decide wether we reject `\(H_0\)` or not, we set a ***significance level*** for the test.

--

* ***Significance level `\((\alpha)\)`:*** acts as a *cutoff* on the p-value.

  * Common values are `\(\alpha = 0.01\)`, `\(0.05\)`, or `\(0.1\)`.

--

* ***Decision***:
  * If the p-value falls ***below the cutoff `\(\alpha\)`***, we "***reject the null hypothesis at the significance level `\(\alpha\)`***."

--

  * Alternatively, if the p-value if ***greater than `\(\alpha\)`***, we say that we "***fail to reject the null hypothesis `\(H_0\)` at the significance level `\(\alpha\)`***."

--

* ***Interpretation***: If what we observe *is too unlikely to happen* under the null hypothesis, it means that this hypothesis is ***likely to be false***.

--

* Let's illustrate how it works in our example. 

---

# Visualizing the P-value

&lt;img src="CI_and_hypothesis_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

The shaded area correponds to the p-value!

---

# Obtaining the p-value and Deciding

* Recall the definition of the p-value: ***probability of observing a test statistic *just as or more extreme* than the one we obtained, assuming the null hypothesis `\(H_0\)` is true.***

--

* The shaded area corresponds to the share of ***test statistics under the null hypothesis*** that exceed the ***observed test statistic*** (0.292).


```r
p_value &lt;- mean(null_distribution$stat &gt;= 0.292)
p_value
```

```
## [1] 0.007
```

* In a world without discrimination, we would get `\(\hat{p_m} - \hat{p_f}\)` superior (or equal) to 0.292 only 0.7% of the time. 
--

* So, we can reject `\(H_0\)`, i.e. the absence of discrimination, at the 5% significance level.

  * We also say that `\(\hat{p_m} - \hat{p_f} = 0.292\)` is ***statistically significantly different from 0*** at the 5% level. 
 
--

* ***Question***: Suppose we had set `\(\alpha = 0.01 = 1\%\)`, would we have rejected the absence of discrimination at this level? 

---

# Testing Errors

Working with probabilities implies that sometimes, we make **errors**.

--

* A 29%p difference may be *unlikely* under `\(H_0\)`, but that **doesn't mean it's *impossible* to occur**.

  * In fact, such a difference (or higher) would occur (approximately) in 0.007% of cases.
  
--

* So, it may happen that we sometimes reject `\(H_0\)`, when in fact it was true.

  * Setting 5% significance level, you make sure it won't happen more than 5% of the time. 

---

# Testing Errors

In hypothesis testing, there are ***two types of errors***:

.pull-left[

![:scale 100%](../img/photos/gt_error_table_ht.png)

]

.pull-right[

***Type I error***: reject the null hypothesis when in fact it was true. ***false positive***
  
***Type II error***: don't reject the null hypothesis when in fact it was false. ***false negative***

]

* In practice, we choose the frequency of a Type I error by setting `\(\alpha\)` and try to minimize the type II error.

---

# How does all of this relate to regression analysis? 

* Now you have all the tools to make ***statistical inference*** for real!

--

* Regression analysis is based on a ***sample*** of data.

--

* So your ***regression coefficient*** is subject to ***sampling variation***, it's not the true population coefficient.

--

* ***Question***: Is the estimated effect statistically significantly different from 0?

--

* The answer in the next episode of *Introduction to Econometrics with R*! 🐵
