# Recap from last week

* Sampling: ***sampling variation*** and ***distribution distributions***

* population, population parameter, sample statistic or point estimate, random sampling

* ***Unbiased estimator***: $\mathop{\mathbb{E}}[\hat{p}] = p$

* ***Central Limit Theorem***: as sample size increases, sampling distribution is more ***normally distributed***, centered around the ***population parameter***, and has a smaller ***standard error***

--

## Today: Deeper dive into ***statistical inference*** <sup>1</sup>

* Process of making claims about a population based on information from a sample

* *Confidence intervals*: providing plausible ***range*** of values

* *Hypothesis testing*: comparing statistics between groups

# Back to reality (there goes gravity `r emo::ji("wink")`)

.pull-right[

* In real life we only get to take ***one*** sample from the population (not ***1000***!).

* Also, we obviously don't know the true population parameter, that's what we are interested in!

* So what on earth was all of this good for? Fun only?! `r emo::ji("anguished")`

]

--

<br>
<br>

* Even unobserved, we ***know*** that the sampling distribution does exist, and even better, we know how it behaves!

* Let's see what we can do with this...

# From Point Estimates to Confidence Intervals

* Until now, we have only estimated ***point estimates*** from our samples: *sample means*, *sample proportions*, *regression coefficients*, etc.

--

* We know that this ***sample statistic*** differs from the ***true population parameter*** due to ***sampling variation***. 

--

* Rather than a point estimate, we could give a ***range of plausible values*** for the population parameter.

--

* This is precisely what a ***confidence interval*** (CI) provides.

---

# Constructing Confidence Intervals 

There are several approaches to constructing confidence intervals:
    
  1. *Theory*: use mathematical formulas (***Central Limit Theorem***) to derive the sampling distribution of our point estimate under certain conditions.

--

  1. *Simulation.* use the ***bootstrapping*** method to *reconstruct* the sampling distribution of our point estimate.
    
--
    
We'll focus on simulation to give you the intuition and come back to the maths approach next week.

--

But first: what is a *bootstrap*?

---

# Bootstrapping

* ***Key idea***: *pretend* the sample **is** the population, and repeatedly *resample with replacement* from it until obtaining a new sample of the same size as the original sample.

--

* Bootstrapping does ***not*** improve point estimation.

--

* But it yields a very good estimate of the ***standard error*** of the ***sampling distribution***.

# Back to Pasta

```{r, echo = FALSE}
bowl <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/qpjsk0rfgc0gx80/pasta.csv?dl=1")

p = mean(bowl$color=="green")
sample_size = 40

my_sample = bowl %>%
  mutate(color = as.factor(ifelse(color == "green","green","non-green"))) %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = sample_size) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(pasta_ID, color) %>%
  arrange(pasta_ID)
```

* As in real life, we have access to *only one random sample* from the entire population.

--

* So let's start by drawing one random sample of size $n = 40$ from our bowl

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bowl <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/qpjsk0rfgc0gx80/pasta.csv?dl=1")

my_sample = bowl %>%
  mutate(color = as.factor(ifelse(color == "green","green","non-green"))) %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 40) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(pasta_ID, color) %>%
  arrange(pasta_ID)
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
head(my_sample)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
p_hat = mean(my_sample$color == "green")
p_hat
```

The proportion of green pasta in this sample is: $\hat{p} = `r p_hat`$.
]

---

# Boostrapping our Pasta Sample

How do we get a ***bootstrap sample***?

--
  
  1. Randomly pick ***one*** pasta from the sample and record the associated color.
  
--
  
  1. Put this pasta back in the sample.
  
--
  
  1. Repeat steps 1 and 2 39 times, i.e. until your new sample is of the same size as the original sample.

--

  1. Compute the proportion of green pasta in the bootstrap sample.

---

# Boostrapping our Pasta Sample

Here is one bootstrap sample: 

.pull-left[

```{r}
one_bootstrap = my_sample %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 40, replace = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(pasta_ID)

head(one_bootstrap)

nrow(one_bootstrap)

mean(one_bootstrap$color == "green")
```
]

--

.pull-right[

* All pasta are drawn from our initial sample.

* You can notice that:

  * Several pasta have been drawn multiple times! That's normal because we did ***resampling with replacement***.

  * The bootstrap sample size is equal to our initial sample size.
  
  * The proportion of green pasta is very similar to that in our sample.
]

  
---

# Obtaining the Bootstrap Distribution

* Repeating the whole procedure 1000 times, you will get 1000 bootstrap samples and 1000 bootstrap estimates!

* We use the `infer` package to ease the bootstrapping procedure.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
bootstrap_distrib = my_sample %>% # take my random sample
  specify(response = color, success = "green") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop")

percentile_95ci = get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_distrib, level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_95lb = percentile_95ci[[1]]
percentile_95ub = percentile_95ci[[2]]

```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(infer)

bootstrap_distrib = my_sample %>% # take my random sample
  specify(response = color, success = "green") %>% # specify the variable and level of interest
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% # generate 1000 bootstrap samples 
  calculate(stat = "prop") # calculate the proportion of green pasta for each
```

--

* Here are the first 3 rows:

```{r}
head(bootstrap_distrib,3)
```

---

# Visualizing Our Simulated Distribution

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8}
visualize(bootstrap_distrib, fill = "darkgreen") + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.4, 0.8)) +
  # geom_vline(xintercept = p_hat, col = "green", size = 1, linetype = 2) +
      labs(x = "Proportion of green pasta",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Simulated Bootstrap Distribution") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14)
```

---

# Building a 95% Confidence Interval

* Let's define an interval that covers 95% of our bootstrapped estimates.

* We get it by cutting the boostrap distribution at the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles.

--

* It defines our 95% CI as: $CI^B = [q_{2,5\%} ; q_{97,5\%}]$

* In our case gives: $[`r round(percentile_95lb,2)` ; `r  round(percentile_95ub,2)`]$

```{r}
quantile(bootstrap_distrib$stat,0.025)
quantile(bootstrap_distrib$stat,0.975)
```

---

# Building a 95% Confidence Interval: Visually

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.height = 4.75, fig.width = 8}
percentile_95ci = get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_distrib, level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_95lb = percentile_95ci[[1]]

       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Simulated Bootstrap Distribution") +
    theme_bw(base_size = 14)
```

--

* Does the interval contain the true population proportion?

True population parameter (blue line) is indeed in our 95% interval! Will it always be?

# Recap Confidence Interval


* In order to construct a confidence interval, we need: 

--

  1. An underlying **sampling distribution of the estimate**, either boostrapped as in our example, or derived from theory.
  
--
  
  2. To specify a **confidence level**, like 90%, 95% etc. 
  
--

> *Precise interpretation:* If we repeated our sampling procedure ***a large number of times***, we ***expect about 95%*** of the resulting confidence intervals to capture the value of the population parameter.

--

> *Short-hand interpretation:* We are ***95% “confident”*** that a 95% confidence interval captures the value of the population parameter.

--

***Questions:*** 

  * How does the size of the confidence interval evolves when setting higher levels of confidence?
  * How does the size of the confidence interval evolves when the sample size increases?

# From Confidence Intervals to Hypothesis Testing

* *Confidence intervals* can be thought of as an extension of *point estimation*.

--

* What if we want to ***compare*** a sample statistic for two groups?
  
  * *Example*: differences in average wages between men and women.
  
--

* These comparisons are the realm of ***hypothesis testing***.

--

* Just like confidence intervals, hypothesis tests are used to make claims about a population based on information from a sample.

* However, we’ll see that the framework for making such inferences is slightly different.

# Is There Gender Discrimination In Promotions?

Let's start with a example.

.left-wide[
* We will use data from an [article](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/39f6/d40e907ff08af4ddd3280c2ceee55ee1ddb6.pdf) published in the *Journal of Applied Psychology* in 1974 which investigates whether female employees at Banks are discriminated against.

* 48 (male) supervisors were given *identical* candidate CVs, differing only with respect to the first name, which was male or female.

  * Each CV was "*in the form of a memorandum requesting a decision on the promotion of an employee to the position of branch manager.*"

* ***Hypothesis*** we want to test: *Is there gender discrimination?*

* The data from the experiment are provided in the `promotions` dataset from the `moderndive` package.

# Hypothesis testing: Basic Framework

1. We assume that the hypothesis we want to test is true.

  * In our case: no gender discrimination in promotions.

--

1. Then we evaluate how consistent the data is with this hypothetical world. 

  * In our case: how likely it is to observe a 29 percentage point difference in promotion rates in a world with no discrimination. 

---


# Imposing A Hypothetical World: No Gender Discrimination

# Sampling Variation

* In our hypothetical world, the difference in promotion rate was only about 4.2 percentage points.

* Can we answer our initial question about the existence of gender discrimination now?

--

* No, we must look at the role of ***sampling variation***!

  * What if we reshuffle once again, how different from 4.2%p would the difference be?

--
  
  * In other words, how representative of that hypothetical world is 4.2%p?
  
--
  
  * Relatedly, how likely is a 29%p difference to occur in such a world?
  
--

* We need to know about the whole sampling distribution under the *no discrimination* hypothesis.

--

* How? Just by redoing the reshuffling a large number of times, and computing the difference each time.

How ***likely*** is it to observe a 29.2 percentage point difference in a world with no discrimination?

---

# Recap

* We observed a 29 percentage point difference in promotion rate between women and men in the real world.

--

* The question is whether in a hypothetical universe with no discrimination, 29%p is ***likely*** to occur.

--

* We concluded ***rather not***, i.e. we tended to ***reject*** the no discrimination hypothesis.

--

* We just conducted our first hypothesis test! 

  * We actually did a ***permutation test***. We randomly reshuffled gender accross promotion decisions and checked if it makes a difference.

--

* Let's introduce the formal framework of hypothesis testing now.

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions

* A ***hypothesis test*** consists of a test between ***two competing hypotheses*** about the population parameter:

--

  * The ***null hypothesis*** $(H_0)$: generally hypothesis of no difference;
--
  
  * The ***alternative hypothesis*** $(H_A \textrm{or }H_1)$: the research hypothesis.

--

* In the previous example:
$$\begin{align}H_0&: p_m - p_f = 0\\H_A&: p_m - p_f > 0,\end{align}$$
where $p_m =$ promotion rate of men, and $p_f =$ promotion rate of women.

--

  * Here, we considered a *one-sided* alternative, saying that $p_m > p_f$, i.e. women are discriminated against.
  * The *two-sided* formulation is just $H_A: p_m - p_f \neq 0$

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions

* ***Test statistic***: *point estimate/sample statistic* formula used for hypothesis testing. 

--

  * *In our previous case*: $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f$.

--

* ***Observed test statistic***: value of the test statistic that we observed in real life.

--

  * *In our previous case*: $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f = 29.2$ percentage points.
  
--

* ***Null distribution***: sampling distribution of the test statistic *assuming the null hypothesis $H_0$ is true*.

--
  *  *In our previous case*: All the possible values that $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f$ can take assuming there is no discrimination.
  * That's the distribution we have seen just before.
 
---

# Null Distribution

```

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions

> ### ***p-value:*** probability of observing a test statistic *more extreme* than the one we obtained, assuming $H_0$ is true. `r emo::ji("thinking")`

  * How *strong* a piece of evidence is it to observe $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f=29$ percentage points in a world where $p_m - p_f=0$ is assumed true? Very strong? Not so strong?

  * How many samples did we obtain that had a difference *greater* than 29%p? Many, or not so many?

--

* ***Interpretation***: The lower the p-value, the *less consistent our null hypothesis is with the observed statistic*.

--

* Ok but when do we decide to reject $H_0$ or not? 

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions

* To decide wether we reject $H_0$ or not, we set a ***significance level*** for the test.

--

* The ***significance level*** $\alpha$ is a *cutoff* on the p-value.

  * Common values are $\alpha = 1\%$, $5\%$, or $10\%$ .

--

* ***Decision***: If the p-value falls below the cutoff $\alpha$, we ***reject*** the null hypothesis at the significance level $\alpha$.

* ***Interpretation***: If what we observe *is too unlikely to happen* under the null hypothesis, it means that this hypothesis is ***likely to be false***.

--

* Let's illustrate how it works in our example. 

---

# Visualizing the P-value

```{r,fig.height = 4.75, fig.width = 8, echo = FALSE}
obs_diff_prop <- promotions %>%
  specify(decision ~ gender, success = "promoted") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("male", "female"))

visualize(null_distribution, bins = 10, fill = "blue") + 
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_prop,
                size = 0.5,
                direction = "right", 
                fill = "red") +
  labs(x = "Differences in promotion rates (male - female)",
       y = "Frequency") +
  xlim(-0.4, 0.4)+
  theme_bw(base_size = 14)
```

--

The p-value measures the probability of being to the right of the red line.

]


---

# Obtaining the p-value and Deciding

* The red areas corresponds to the share of ***simulated differences in promotion rates under the null hypothesis*** that exceed the ***observed test statistic*** (0.292).

```{r}
p_value <- mean(null_distribution$stat >= 0.292)
p_value
```

* In a world without discrimination, we would get $\hat{p_m} - \hat{p_f}$ superior (or equal) to 29.2%p only `r 100*p_value`% of the time. 
--

* So, we can reject $H_0$, i.e. the absence of discrimination, at the 5% significance level. 

  * We also say that $\hat{p_m} - \hat{p_f} = 29.2$%p is ***statistically significantly different from 0*** at the 5% level. 
 
--

* ***Question***: Suppose we had set $\alpha = 0.01 = 1\%$, would we have rejected the absence of discrimination at this level? 

---

# Testing Errors

Working with probabilities implies that sometimes, we make **errors**.

--

* A 29%p difference may be *unlikely* under $H_0$, but that **doesn't mean it's *impossible* to occur**.

  * In fact, such a difference (or higher) would occur in 1.9% of the cases.
  
--

* So, it may happen that we sometimes reject $H_0$, when in fact it was true.

  * Setting 5% significance level, you make sure it won't happen more than 5% of the time. 

---

# Testing Errors

In hypothesis testing, there are ***two types of errors***:

.pull-left[

![:scale 100%](../img/photos/gt_error_table_ht.png)

]

.pull-right[

***Type I error***: reject the null hypothesis when in fact it was true.
  
***Type II error***: don't reject the null hypothesis when in fact it was false.

]

* In practice, we choose the frequency of a Type I error by setting $\alpha$ and try to minimize the type II error.

---

# How does all of this relate to regression analysis? 

* Now you have all the tools to make ***statistical inference*** for real!

--

* Regression analysis is based on a ***sample*** of data.

--

* So your ***regression coefficient*** is subject to ***sampling variation***, it's not the true population coefficient.

--

* ***Question***: Is the estimated effect statistically significantly different from 0?
